There were 335 deaths during the study.\nBut for every 10 deaths among those eating the least ultra-processed food, there were 16 deaths among those eating the most (more than four portions a day).\n, by the University of Paris, followed 105,159 people for five years and assessed their diet twice a year.\nIt showed those eating more ultra-processed food had worse heart health. \nRates of cardiovascular disease were 277 per 100,000 people per year among those eating the most ultra-processed food, compared with 242 per 100,000 among those eating the least. \nThe rapid increase of ultra-processed foods over less processed foods, \"may drive a substantial burden of cardiovascular diseases in the next decades,\" said Dr Mathilde Touvier, of the University of Paris.\n\"[The] evidence is accumulating,\" said Dr Touvier, noting \"increasing numbers of independent studies\". Prof Bes-Rastrollo said she was \"very certain\" ultra-processed foods were bad for health.\nLast year, a link was made with \n.\nThe challenge is being 100% sure. The studies have spotted a pattern between highly processed food and poor health but they cannot prove that one causes the other. \nThose who ate the most ultra-processed food were also more likely to have other unhealthy behaviours, such as smoking, which the researchers tried to account for. \nBut there's no guarantee everything relevant was covered, says Kevin McConway, a professor of statistics at The Open University.\n\"These studies do increase my confidence that there's something real behind these associations - but I'm still far from sure.\"\nThe first trial of ultra-processed foods showed they led people to eat more and put on weight. \nResearchers at the US National Institutes of Health monitored every morsel of food that volunteers ate for a month.\nAnd when given ultra-processed food, they ate 500 calories a day more than when they were given unprocessed meals.\nOther suggestions include: \nThese ideas still need researching.\nWhile the term ultra-processed food may be new, the health advice will be very familiar: adopt a Mediterranean-style diet.\nSuch a diet includes plenty of minimally or unprocessed foods, such as fruit, vegetables, fish, nuts and seeds, beans, lentils and wholegrains, said Victoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation.\n\"This, along with exercising regularly and not smoking, has been shown to be beneficial for lowering risk of heart and circulatory disease.\"\nMeasures such as taxation and marketing restrictions on ultra-processed foods, should be considered, said Prof Bes-Rastrollo, given the weight of evidence. \nThere are certainly a lot of critics. \nThe labelling of food as ultra-processed could be inconsistent, said Dr Gunter Kuhnle, an expert in nutrition and health at the University of Reading\n\"It is also not obvious why salami is considered to be ultra-processed, yet cheese, which often requires considerably more processing steps and additives, is not.  The classification combines a wide range of foods with very different potential impacts on health, which limits its usefulness as a basis for recommendations.\"\nThe studies were published in the British Medical Journal.", "topic": "health", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/48C1/production/_107152681_gettyimages-962483230.jpg"}, {"title": "10 years of Grindr: A rocky relationship", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-47668951", "content": "It was 10 years ago, on the bus on my way to work, that I first saw a man using Grindr. \nI had heard friends describe a free iPhone app that could show you where the nearest gay guy was. And sat in front of me was an early adopter, tapping his way through a grid of topless torsos and replying to a flurry of messages. \nThe concept was extraordinary. \nWhen Grindr launched in March 2009, the iPhone was still in its infancy. \nBack then, the BlackBerry was king. Apple's app store was less than a year old and there was no Instagram or Snapchat. There was also no Tinder or Scruff or Bumble, or any of the countless other location-based dating apps that Grindr paved the way for. \nThe app was created by Israeli entrepreneur Joel Simkhai as a way for gay men to make friends. \nGay hook-up websites such as Gaydar were already used by millions. But Grindr changed the game by using the iPhone's satellite location data to let people discover other men nearby. \nGrindr quickly toppled Gaydar, which was slow to adapt its own app. Online dating and the future of the gay scene changed forever. \nToday, Grindr says it has about four million daily users in about 200 countries.\n\"It's an Argos catalogue of gay men, in stock, ready for collection,\" says comedian Jack Rooke, who tells stories of his Grindr experiences as part of his stand-up.\nAs a young man, coming to terms with his sexuality, it also helped him connect with his peers.\n\"It was just good to speak to another gay human being,\" he says, describing the time he went to a man's house for a hook-up but ended up discussing life over homemade pitta bread and dips instead.\n\"Grindr was for me the place where I learned so much about gay culture and queer culture and what it means to be a gay person.\"\nThe app has its fair share of success stories. Great hook-ups, happy marriages. \nBut something about Grindr also drew out the worst in people. Stories about receiving unsolicited abusive messages, or arranging dates with men who did not show up, or sharing intimate photos with a fake profile soon spread online.\nFor most of its history, racist bios were common on Grindr dating profiles.\n\"You would see profiles saying no Asians, no blacks, no fat people,\" says Jack. \"There's been a huge space for prejudice on that app, I think since day one.\"\nDating no-shows and racist messages spurred blogger Andrew Londyn to write a book describing how to \"survive\" Grindr.\nHe recalls chatting several times with a \"very handsome Greek guy\". Eventually the man asked why the pair had not met for a drink. \n\"You haven't asked me out yet,\" Andrew replied in jest. But the response was bleak: a tirade of racist abuse.\n\"That was infuriating. You just asked me out, and now that?\" says Andrew.\nOn his \n, Andrew describes the loss of \"community\" he feels apps such as Grindr have contributed to. Previously men of all ages, backgrounds and body types would meet in bars and spend time together. But today, people can select their friends from the online catalogue instead.\n\"We're dehumanising each other,\" says Andrew.\n\"We don't think of it as an individual who is reaching out to me. They have a mother and a father, they probably have siblings, they work, they want to be happy. But we just view them as a picture. If you view them only as a picture, they're easily disposed of.\"\nThe arrival of Grindr and the rival apps it inspired brought a fresh challenge for LGBT venues, many of which have seen visitor numbers decline.\n\"Grindr was the next evolution along from the internet, as to how gay men started to meet each other and hook-up,\" says Mark Oakley, owner of the Eagle bar in London.\nTen years ago, his venue was renowned for its late night sex parties. A black curtain separated the bar from the \"dark room\", where anything could happen. On a Saturday you could \"hear the spanking down at Vauxhall station\".\nBut demand for that type of night out declined as Grindr's popularity grew. \n\"Grindr came along offering a much more direct route to sex with no real barriers. Why would people want to go to a club, pay a door entry fee, pay for drinks, when there might not even be anyone there they like?\"\nMark accepts it was a natural progression for sex to move online, comparing it to the entertainment industry shift from CDs and DVDs to downloads and streaming.\n\"Businesses have had to shape up, or ship out.\n\"For us to survive in today's market we had to evolve and change in to what we've become now. We had a considerable refit, brought in a new look and feel. Now it's all about the music and entertainment.\"\nThe black curtain, he says, was ceremoniously discharged and recycled.\nGrindr has at times been used for the worst imaginable crimes. In 2016, serial killer Stephen Port was \n and raping four others. He used Grindr to set up his killings. And in 2018, Daryll Rowe was jailed for deliberately passing HIV on to several other men he met on Grindr.\nAny new technology can be used for terrible purposes. But Mark fears Grindr has left a \"wreckage\" in its wake, by making it easier for lonely or isolated men to meet people offering drugs and \n. \nOfficially, \n prohibit \"mentions or photos of drugs and drug paraphernalia, including emoji\" but that does not deter everyone.\nSome profiles openly advertise HNH (high and horny) meet-ups. The diamond emoji is often used by people offering crystal meth. Grindr is not to blame for gay and bi men taking drugs, but it may have made it more accessible.\n\"Grindr has a social responsibility and it should take that seriously,\" says Mark.\n\"They put up messages, but they could do a lot more. The licensed trade has to control what happens on our premises. Why don't they?\"\nIn January 2018, Grindr was fully \n. It paid a total of $245m (\u00a3185m) for the platform, and creator Joel Simkhai left the company. \nSince the publication of this article, the company told the BBC that privacy remained its \"top priority\" and all user data was stored in the United States.\nOne of the first changes after the acquisition was the launch of the Kindr Grindr campaign, designed to \"address issues such as sexual racism, transphobia, and body shaming\".\n\"Kindr is built on education, awareness, and specific policy changes in the Grindr app to promote healthier interactions among our users,\" the company told the BBC.\nThe app also changed its community guidelines. Now, anybody using racist or dehumanising language on their profiles can be banned if reported.\n\"We are also actively working to update our new user on-boarding experience, which will guide new members through their first steps of using Grindr, highlighting the importance of positive behaviour when communicating with others in our platform,\" the company said.\nLooking ahead, Jack hopes Grindr will continue to evolve and tackle toxic behaviour.\n\"I hope Grindr becomes a tool for more good,\" he says, especially as some groups in the UK are \"discussing whether or not we should \n\".\nGrindr told the BBC its priority would always be to help the LGBT community \"connect and thrive\".\n\"As part of our ten-year anniversary, we are placing a strong focus on authenticity. We want our users to have meaningful and authentic experiences. In the coming year, we will be rolling out new features, showcasing real stories of real users, getting involved in community events, and finding more ways to give back to the LGBT community,\" a spokeswoman said.\nIn the fast-paced world of apps and websites, market leaders can be quickly toppled.

So here are the tips I picked up along the way while making \n.\nResearchers Eric Alm and Lawrence David have some of the most studied microbiomes on the planet. \nThey spent a year analysing 548 of their stool samples. \nLawrence David, an assistant professor at the Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology, said diet had the biggest influence on the microbiome - and one thing was especially effective.\nHe says: \"One of the leading sets of molecules that people are getting excited about have to do with plants, specifically fibre. \n\"It's what at least some bacteria in the gut love to eat.\"\nHe says plant fibre is likely to benefit most people's microbiome, though he admits the study has just made him feel more guilty about the food he eats.\n \"I still eat hamburgers and chicken nuggets,\" he confides.\nFibre is a prebiotic, providing fuel for the microbes that are in our digestive system. \nBut Dr Paul Cotter, who I met at the University of Cork, is concerned we're not introducing enough new microbes into our bodies. \nHe told me: \"An awful lot of what we eat now are foods within tins or with an awful lot of shelf-life and they have a long shelf-life simply because there are very few, or not any, microbes within them.\"\nHis field is fermented foods that bacteria have gone to town on before you eat them. \nFermented foods include well-known favourites, such as cheese and yoghurt, but also the milk drink kefir, a tea called kumbucha and certain cabbage dishes, such as sauerkraut or the Korean kimchi. \nDr Cotter says most people should be thinking of adding fermented foods to their diet as the microbes in them help calibrate the immune system.\nHe said: \"If you're already healthy, the way to go is consume fermented food rather than going for a particular \n\" - although studies have shown some probiotic products can help prevent \n and \n in some cases.\n on BBC Radio 4.\nFibre and fermented foods are a good rule of thumb, but there is no guarantee they will work for everyone. \nEverybody's microbiome is unique, so the spectacular biology they are performing in the gut varies from one person to the next. \nEric Alm, of serial-faeces-monitoring fame and the co-director of the Center for Microbiome Informatics and Therapeutics at MIT, argues dietary advice will have to be more personalised in the future.\nHe says: \"One thing that we're learning is, based on the microbiome, different people may need to consume different diets in order to get the same effect.\"\nHe has studied what different people's microbiomes do with different dietary fibres. \nBroadly, fibres are broken down into chemicals called short chain fatty acids.\nThey can be absorbed by the intestines and have effects throughout the body. It is one of the ways the microbiome is thought to influence our health. \nProf Alm's work showed some people's microbiome was very good at making short chain fatty acids from a dietary fibre called pectin, which is found in apples and oranges.\nOther people's needed inulin (found in leeks, asparagus and onions) to make the same short chain fatty acids. \nProf Alm says: \"You can imagine a future where if you needed to increase the levels of butyrate (a type of short chain fatty acid) production in the gut, which some people think might be advantageous for diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, you might sequence your microbiome first.\n\"[Then] figure out what species are there, then take a prebiotic or dietary fibre supplement that matched the microbes you have to produce butyrate.\"\nFollow James ", "topic": "health", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/4D84/production/_100844891_humanbehind16_9.jpg"}, {"title": "YouTube star Etika's fans tattooed in his memory", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48853270", "content": "When YouTuber Etika was found dead on 25 June 2019 it shocked thousands of fans and fellow video bloggers.\nEtika, real name Desmond Amofah, 29, built a following of 130,000 YouTube subscribers by reacting to releases and products from gaming company Nintendo.\nAt one point he had a YouTube channel with more than 800,000 subscribers before it was removed from the platform.\nMany fans reacted to his death by changing their online avatars to Etika's logo, but others have gone a step further to pay their respects.\nThese people have been permanently tattooed in Etika's memory.\nArturo, 20, is part of YouTube group im salt, which initially gained a following by making highlight videos of Etika's YouTube streams.\nThe channel now has around 60,000 subscribers and focuses on original content, but its creators have not forgotten how they began.\n\"We always loved and supported Etika,\" Arturo said. \"When he died it struck all of us pretty hard. \n\"We decided to do one big charity stream, playing games Etika liked, and we had some milestones: If we raised $2,000 (\u00a31,591) I would get an Etika tattoo.\n\"We reached it about an hour in.

It did not need a bag to collect dust; instead it spun air really fast, creating a cyclone that flung dust outwards where it could be collected.\nHe realised the potential was there for a bag-free and more efficient machine.\nSir James rushed back to his house, dismantled his vacuum cleaner and attached a cyclone device, hastily made from cardboard and sticking tape.\n\"I started pushing it around the room and it worked,\" \n in 1999.\nFour years, and more than 5,000 prototypes later, he had a machine that worked to his satisfaction.\nIt was not obvious from Sir James's schooling and early college years that he would become a leading inventor and industrial designer.\nSir James, whose father died when he was a child, grew up in Norfolk in the 1950s. Speaking about his childhood he said, \"Money was very unimportant and what was much more important to me, and was a greater gift, was the countryside, the seaside, the sand dunes, the freedom.\"\nHaving studied art at school, he went on to art college in London where the principal suggested that he go into design.\nHe became influenced by the ideas of US architect and designer Buckminster Fuller, known for elegant domes.\n\"Here was an engineer creating this engineering structure which was incredibly beautiful, without even trying to be beautiful.\n\"Its elegance came not from its styling but from its engineering and I latched on to that.\"\nInspired by such work, he helped design the Sea Truck, a high-speed boat, built for beach landings.\nBut Sir James wanted his own project and that came in 1974 - a wheelbarrow that featured a large spherical plastic wheel. The ballbarrow was designed to be easier to fill, empty and manoeuvre than existing barrows.\nThe invention was a commercial success, but in building the business Sir James lost control to outside investors and it was sold against his wishes.\nIt was an experience he was determined not to repeat with his next invention, the bagless vacuum cleaner.\nBy the early 1980s he had a working prototype, but developing it into a commercial product was a gruelling process that took another 10 years and almost bankrupted him.\nAt one stage he owed his bank more than a million pounds.\n\"That's probably why it took me such a long time to get the vacuum cleaner going, because I didn't have any money. I've always been heavily in debt.\n\"The bank got pretty nervous at times, but they stood by me,\" he said.\nAfter some false starts, the first machine sold under the Dyson brand was launched in the UK in 1993 and soon became the biggest selling vacuum cleaner in the country.\nDyson products were made in Wiltshire until 2002, when \n, a move that was unpopular with many at the time, but has proved to be a commercial success.\nIn recent years Dyson has launched hairdryers, fans and lights and now employs more than 12,000 staff worldwide, including around 4,800 in the UK.\nThat has all translated into healthy profits.

But when a young Englishman, John Lombe, travelled there in the early 18th Century, he was not going to savour a glass of Barolo. His purpose was industrial espionage. \nLombe wished to figure out how the Piedmontese spun strong yarn from silkworm silk. Divulging such secrets was illegal, so Lombe sneaked into a workshop after dark, sketching the spinning machines by candlelight. In 1717, he took those sketches to Derby in the heart of England.\nLocal legend has it that the Italians took a terrible revenge on Lombe, sending a woman to assassinate him. \nWhatever the truth of that, he died suddenly at the age of 29, just a few years after his Piedmont adventure.\nWhile Lombe may have copied Italian secrets, the way he and his older half-brother used them was completely original. \nThe Lombes were textile dealers, and seeing a shortage of the strong silk yarn called organzine, they decided to go big.\nIn the centre of Derby, beside the fast-flowing River Derwent, the Lombe brothers built a structure that was to be imitated around the world: a long, slim, five-storey building with plain brick walls cut by a grid of windows. \nThe building, completed in 1721, housed three dozen large machines powered by a 7m-high waterwheel. It was a dramatic change in scale from what had been done before. The age of the large factory had begun with a thunderclap.\n highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world.\nIt is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find \n and \n or \n.\nIt is a testament to the no-nonsense functionality of the Derby silk mill that it operated for 169 years, pausing only on Sundays, and for droughts - when the Derwent flowed slow and low. \nOver that period of time, the world economy grew more than fivefold, and factories were a major part of that growth. \nIntellectuals took note. Author Daniel Defoe came to gaze in wonder at the silk mill. Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, begins with a description of a pin factory. Three decades later, William Blake penned his famous line about England's \"dark Satanic Mills\".  \nConcerns about the conditions in factories have persisted ever since. Critics claimed that factory exploitation was a similar evil to slavery, a shocking claim then and now. \nAfter visiting the mills of Manchester in 1832, the novelist Frances Trollope wrote that factory conditions were \"incomparably more severe\" than those suffered by plantation slaves. \nThe recruiting wagons which toured the rural areas of 1850s Massachusetts hoping to persuade \"rosy-cheeked maidens\" to come to the city to work in the mills were dubbed \"slavers\". \nFriedrich Engels, whose father owned a Manchester factory, wrote powerfully about the harsh conditions, inspiring his friend Karl Marx. \nBut Marx, in turn, saw hope in the fact that so many workers were concentrated together in one place: they could organise unions, political parties, and even revolutions. He was right about the unions and the political parties, but not about the revolutions: those came not in industrialised societies but agrarian ones.\nThe Russian revolutionaries were not slow to embrace the factory. \nIn 1913, Lenin had condemned the stopwatch-driven, micromanaging studies of engineer Frederick Winslow Taylor as \"advances in the extortion of sweat\". After the revolution, the stopwatch was in the other hand, with Lenin announcing: \"We must organise in Russia the study and teaching of the Taylor system.\" \nIn developed economies, Blake's dark Satanic Mills gradually gave way to cleaner, more advanced factories, although of course as Financial Times reporter Sarah O'Connor says, exploitative factories do still exist. However, it is the working conditions of factories in developing countries that now attract the most attention. \nEconomists have tended to believe that sweatshop conditions beat the alternative of even more extreme poverty in rural areas, and they have certainly been enough to draw workers to fast-growing cities around the world. Manufacturing has long been viewed as the engine of rapid economic development.  \nSo what lies next for the factory? History offers several lessons. \nFactories are getting bigger. The 18th Century Derby silk mill employed 300 workers, a radical step at a time when even machine-based labour could take place at home or in a small workshop. The 19th Century Manchester factories that had horrified Engels could employ more than 1,000 people, often including women and children.  \nModern factories in advanced economies are much larger still: Volkswagen's main factory in Wolfsburg, Germany employs more than 60,000 workers - half the town's population. \nAnd the Longhua Science and Technology Park in Shenzhen, China - better known as Foxconn City - employs at least 230,000 workers (and by some estimates 450,000) to make Apple's iPhones and many other products.  \nThese are staggering numbers for a single site: the entire McDonald's franchise worldwide has fewer than two million employees.  \nThe increase in scale is not the only way in which Foxconn City continues the arc of history. \nThere are - as there were in the 1830s - fears for the welfare of workers. In Shenzhen, \n the company installed nets which are designed to catch anyone who leaps from the roof, while it also increased wages and reduced working hours. \nLarge strikes are commonplace in China, but as the FT's Yuan Yang notes, in one of history's great ironies, the Chinese government cracks down hard on the young Marxists who try to get the workers unionised.   \nAnd, as in the West many decades before, there has been some progress. \n says that conditions have dramatically improved over time.  \nTrade secrets kick-started the first factory, and have shaped factories ever since. \nRichard Arkwright, whose 1770s cotton mill was modelled on the Lombe brothers' silk mill, vowed: \"I am Determin'd for the [future] to Let no persons in to Look at the [works].\" \nChinese factories are still secretive: Mr Fallows was surprised to be allowed into the Foxconn plant, but he was told that he must neither show nor mention the brand names coming off the production lines. \nOne thing, however, has changed. \nFactories used to centralise the production process; raw materials came in, finished products went out. Components would be made on site or by suppliers close at hand. This saved on the trouble of transporting heavy or fragile objects in the middle of the manufacturing process.  \nBut today's production processes are themselves global.  \nProduction can be co-ordinated and monitored without the need for physical proximity, while \n and \n streamline the logistics. \nModern factories - even behemoths like Foxconn City - are only steps in a distributed production chain. Components move backwards and forwards across borders in different states of assembly.  \nWorkers in Foxconn City, for example, do not make iPhones. \nAs it says on the back of every handset, they are designed by Apple in California, but \"assembled\" in China, using glass and electronics imported from Japan, Korea, Taiwan and even the USA itself. \nHuge factories have long supplied the world. Now the world itself has become the factory. \nThe author writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.

The argument is we don't just feel sorry for ourselves when we are sick, but that the chemicals involved in inflammation are directly affecting our mood. \nYou can listen to The Inflamed Mind documentary on BBC Radio 4 at 21:00 BST and then \n. \nInflammation is part of the immune system's response to danger. It is a hugely complicated process to prepare our body to fight off hostile forces. \nIf inflammation is too low then an infection can get out of hand. If it is too high, it causes damage. \nAnd for some reason, about one-third of depressed patients have consistently high levels of inflammation. Hayley is one of them: \"I do have raised inflammation markers, I think normal is under 0.7 and mine is 40, it's coming up regularly in blood tests.\"\nThere is now a patchwork quilt of evidence suggesting inflammation is more than something you simply find in some depressed patients, but is actually the cause of their disease. That the immune system can alter the workings of the brain.\nTo explore this revolutionary new idea in depression, we visited an arthritis clinic at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. \nIt is perhaps an unexpected location, but it was in clinics like this that doctors noticed something unusual. \nRheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints. And when patients were given precise anti-inflammatory drugs that calmed down specific parts of the immune response, their mood improved. \nProf Iain McInnes, a consultant rheumatologist, said: \"When we give these therapies we see a fairly rapid increase in a sense of well-being, mood state improving quite remarkably often disproportionately given the amount of inflammation we can see in their joints and their skin.\"\nIt suggests the patients were not simply feeling happier as they were in less pain, but that something more profound was going on. \nProf McInnes added: \"We scanned the brains of people with rheumatoid arthritis, we then gave them a very specific immune targeted therapy and then we imaged them again afterwards.\n\"What we are starting to see when we give anti-inflammatory medicines is quite remarkable changes in the neuro-chemical circuitry in the brain. \n\"The brain pathways involved in mediating depression were favourably changed in people who were given immune interventions.\"\nOne possible explanation is that inflammatory chemicals enter the brain. There they interrupt the production of serotonin - a key neurotransmitter that's linked to mood. \nAbout the self assessment: The first eight questions are taken from a measure known as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 or PHQ-9, used by doctors to assess and monitor depression severity. The PHQ-9 was developed by Dr Robert L Spitzer, Dr Janet B W Williams, Dr Kurt Kroenke and colleagues, with an educational grant from Pfizer Inc.\nTo hear more we visited Carmine Pariante's laboratory at King's College London. The professor of biological psychiatry has been piecing together the evidence on inflammation and depression for 20 years.\nHe told the BBC: \"Nearly 30% to 40% of depressed patients have high levels of inflammation and in these people we think it is part of the causal process.\n\"The evidence supporting this idea is that high levels of inflammation are present even if someone is not depressed, but is at risk of becoming depressed.\n\"We know from studies that if you have high levels of inflammation today you're at higher risk of becoming depressed over the next weeks or months even if you are perfectly well.\" \nHe's shown that not only are depressed patients more likely to have high levels of inflammation, but those with an overactive immune system are also less likely to respond to anti-depressants. \nThis is a big deal because a third of patients don't get any benefit from drug treatments. \nBut there's something confusing here. The immune system responds to infection and that doesn't seem to fit the usual story of depression. \nTake Jennifer Streeting, a trainee midwife in London, who traces her mental health problems back to when she was 14.\n\"My nana passed away and my mum had breast cancer and if you ask my therapist now she puts it down to grief and not really dealing with that at the time, I think there was just a lot going on.\" \nProf Pariante argues it is actually these awful moments in our lives that change our immune system, priming it to increase the risk of depression years later.\nHe said: \"We think the immune system is the key mechanism by which early life events produce this long-term effect.\n\"We have some data showing adult individuals who have a history of early life trauma, even if they have never been depressed, have an activated immune system so they are in a state of risk.\"\nThe hope is that drugs targeting the immune system will provide much needed treatments for patients, particularly for those like Jennifer who seem to have tried them all.\n\"I had sertraline, I had Prozac, there was another one, I got started on citalopram, I was put on duloxetine, mirtazapine as well. I was on three at one point.\"\nShe is now on a combination of drugs that seem to be working for her, but it has been a long journey. \n\"It is totally trial and error,\" said Prof Pariante.\nHe added: \"We are not able to predict right from the beginning whether someone will respond.\n\"We think by measuring inflammation in the blood we'll actually be able to identify individuals that do require more complex, intensive antidepressant treatment, maybe a combination of an antidepressant and and anti-inflammatory.\" \nMost of us have common anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen at home, but doctors warn against experimenting at home, while clinical trials are taking place to prove whether this will work in patients.\nThe world's largest medical research charity, the Wellcome Trust, has brought together universities and the pharmaceutical industry. \nThe aim is to consolidate the evidence to accelerate the field; ultimately they want to find a new treatment for depression and develop a test to identify those who will benefit. \nCambridge University's Prof Bullmore is leading the consortium. But we interviewed him at his other employer, GlaxoSmithKline.\nThe company's immuno-inflammation laboratory is where scientists are developing new molecules which they hope will become effective medicines for inflammatory disorders.\nThat process will take more than a decade, but Prof Bullmore says there may already be a drug out there.\n\"One of the exciting things about immunopsychiatry is that because of the success of immunology in other areas of medicine there are already many drugs that are far beyond this stage of development.\n\"They may already be licensed or in late-stage clinical trials so the timeline from start of work on that project to delivering a medicine that might make a difference to patients could be much shorter.\" \nRaiding the cupboards is already showing signs of success. Those early clues in arthritis mean the anti-inflammatory drug sirukumab is now being trialled in depressed patients.\nSo are drugs targeting the immune system about to transform the treatment of depression?\nProf Bullmore argues: \"I don't think they are going to be a panacea, I don't think we're talking about a scenario in future where every patient with symptoms of depression is going to be offered an anti-inflammatory drug.\n\"I don't think that makes sense and frankly that sort of blockbuster one-size-fits-all approach to development of drugs for psychiatry has not been helpful to us in the past.\n\"We have to take a more personalised or stratified approach, not everyone that is depressed is depressed for the same reason.\"\nThat will require a blood test to identify which patients will benefit from immune-based therapies. \nDepression is a disease that affects hundreds of millions of people. Even if anti-inflammatories help just a small proportion of them - that would still be a huge number of patients. But if immunotherapy becomes a success, its biggest impact may be on the way we think about the disease, making people less likely to believe sufferers should just \"pull themselves together\". \n\"I hate that phrase, if I could I would,\" says Jennifer.\nShe adds: \"Just as if someone had diabetes and their insulin levels weren't working correctly, you wouldn't say, 'Oh snap out of it, stop having a hypo.'\"\nHayley feels the same: \"If there was a way to say depression was a physical problem I think it would make a massive difference, I think people would treat depression as something that is not made up and going on in the head. \n\"It would be seen as a genuine condition, it would validate a lot of people's feelings.\"\nProf Pariante concludes: \"It is groundbreaking because, for the first time, we are demonstrating that depression is not only a disorder of the mind, in fact it is not even only a disorder of the brain, it is a disorder of the whole body.\"", "topic": "health", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/7894/production/_90886803_hayleypic.jpg"}, {"title": "Norwegian Air seeks cash injection", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-47039303", "content": "Norwegian Air wants to raise 3bn Norwegian kroner (\u00a3268m) through a rights issue to improve its finances.\nThe news comes as the company announced that its preliminary earnings for 2018 showed an operating loss of roughly 3.8bn kroner.\nThe budget carrier said it was not in talks with any potential buyers after British Airways owner IAG abandoned its plans to buy it last week.\nIn early trading on Tuesday, the company's shares plunged by 16%.\nBillionaire John Fredriksen and the airline's chief executive Bjorn Kjos and chairman Bjorn Kise have all agreed to underwrite the issue.\nMr Kjos explained that the airline was going to change its strategic focus from growth to making cost savings.\n\"We will now get in place a strengthened balance sheet that supports the further development of the company,\" he said.\nIn a statement, the airline added that this would \"increase its competitiveness and stand-alone financial strength\". \nThe carrier confirmed that flights were unaffected by the news.\nA rights issue happens when existing shareholders of a company are offered the chance to buy new shares at a special price.\nNorwegian is in a race against time. The company is nothing if not ambitious - and it has certainly made an impact in Europe's cut-throat aviation market. But it needs to become consistently profitable, before the money runs out. \nNorwegian's chief executive, Bjorn Kjos, has overseen a major expansion of the airline over the past five years, doubling the size of its fleet and expanding its route network dramatically. But his biggest gambit has been a major play into the low-cost long-haul market.\nCheap transatlantic travel is not a new idea: Freddie Laker tried it in the 1970s. \nBut it was only with the development of highly fuel-efficient aircraft like the Boeing 787 Dreamliner - which Norwegian is using - and the Airbus A350 that the idea really took off. \nNow others are following Norwegian's example.\nBut all of this has come at a price. Norwegian has debts of $3.5bn and expects to rack up a sizeable loss for 2018. \nProblems with engines on its shiny new Dreamliners clearly haven't helped either.\nSmall wonder Mr Kjos now says the carrier will focus on cost-cutting and profitability, rather than growth.

Peter has seen his mum Stephanie, uncle Keith and grandmother Olive die from it.\nTests show his sister Sandy and brother Frank will develop the disease.\nThe three siblings have eight children - all young adults, each of whom has a 50-50 chance of developing the disease.\nThe unstoppable death of brain cells in Huntington's leaves patients in permanent decline, affecting their movement, behaviour, memory and ability to think clearly.\nPeter, from Essex, told me: \"It's so difficult to have that degenerative thing in you.\n\"You know the last day was better than the next one's going to be.\"\nHuntington's is caused by an error in a section of DNA called the huntingtin gene.\nNormally this contains the instructions for making a protein, called huntingtin, which is vital for brain development.\nBut a genetic error corrupts the protein and turns it into a killer of brain cells.\nThe treatment is designed to silence the gene. \nOn the trial, 46 patients had the drug injected into the fluid that bathes the brain and spinal cord.\nThe procedure was carried out at the \n at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in London. \nDoctors did not know what would happen. One fear was the injections could have caused fatal meningitis.\nBut the first in-human trial showed the drug was safe, well tolerated by patients and crucially reduced the levels of huntingtin in the brain.\nProf Sarah Tabrizi, the lead researcher and director of the Huntington's Disease Centre at UCL, told the BBC: \"I've been seeing patients in clinic for nearly 20 years, I've seen many of my patients over that time die.\n\"For the first time we have the potential, we have the hope, of a therapy that one day may slow or prevent Huntington's disease.\n\"This is of groundbreaking importance for patients and families.\"\nDoctors are not calling this a cure. They still need vital long-term data to show whether lowering levels of huntingtin will change the course of the disease. \nThe animal research suggests it would. Some motor function even recovered in those experiments. \nPeter, Sandy and Frank - as well as their partners Annie, Dermot and Hayley - have always promised their children they will not need to worry about Huntington's as there will be a treatment in time for them. \nPeter told the BBC: \"I'm the luckiest person in the world to be sitting here on the verge of having that.\n\"Hopefully that will be made available to everybody, to my brothers and sisters and fundamentally my children.\"\nHe, along with the other trial participants, can continue taking the drug as part of the next wave of trials. \nThey will set out to show whether the disease can be slowed, and ultimately prevented, by treating Huntington's disease carriers before they develop any symptoms.\nProf John Hardy, who was awarded the Breakthrough Prize for his work on Alzheimer's, told the BBC: \"I really think this is, potentially, the biggest breakthrough in neurodegenerative disease in the past 50 years.\n\"That sounds like hyperbole - in a year I might be embarrassed by saying that - but that's how I feel at the moment.\" \nThe UCL scientist, who was not involved in the research, says the same approach might be possible in other neurodegenerative diseases that feature the build-up of toxic proteins in the brain. \nThe protein synuclein is implicated in Parkinson's while amyloid and tau seem to have a role in dementias. \nOff the back of this research, trials are planned using gene-silencing to lower the levels of tau. \nProf Giovanna Mallucci, who discovered the first chemical to prevent the death of brain tissue in any neurodegenerative disease, said the trial was a \"tremendous step forward\" for patients and there was now \"real room for optimism\".\nBut Prof Mallucci, who is the associate director of UK Dementia Research Institute at the University of Cambridge, cautioned it was still a big leap to expect gene-silencing to work in other neurodegenerative diseases. \nShe told the BBC: \"The case for these is not as clear-cut as for Huntington's disease, they are more complex and less well understood.\n\"But the principle that a gene, any gene affecting disease progression and susceptibility, can be safely modified in this way in humans is very exciting and builds momentum and confidence in pursuing these avenues for potential treatments.\"\nThe full details of the trial will be presented to scientists and published next year. \nThe therapy was developed by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, which said the drug had \"substantially exceeded\" expectations, and the licence has now been sold to Roche. \nFollow James ", "topic": "health", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/13BF/production/_99155050_img_2496.jpg"}, {"title": "Truth, fires and tumble dryers: Are our home appliances safe?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-37572532", "content": "On a chilly Monday afternoon in late November, an email landed in my bulging inbox with information about a \"potential safety issue\".\n\"Hi there,\" it began. \"I wanted to make sure you were aware of an Indesit repair programme.\"\nTumble dryers sold in the UK over the course of 11 years were in danger of causing a fire and needed to be made safe. I would later learn that there were 5.3 million of them.\nDramatic proof was provided this summer when one machine, awaiting a repair, \n which left families homeless and needed 120 firefighters to bring under control.\nOn a basic level this is a story about clearing the build-up of fluff from dryers. On a much more serious level, it is a lesson in how much, or how little, we are told about dangerous, potentially lethal, appliances in our homes.\nThat understated original email message was an opaque window into a saga that one MP described in Parliament as \"corporate malpractice on a grand scale\". \nThe starting point of much drama and debate came in 2014 when the biggest appliance manufacturer in the world, US-based Whirlpool, \n.\nConsumer groups had long warned of the danger of defective white goods. After reviewing the products under its ownership, Whirlpool decided to alert authorities in the UK and Europe of the safety issue with some dryers under the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands. It subsequently added the Proline brand to this list.\nThese appliances were sold for more than a decade from April 2004 to September 2015. They were found in Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain, as well as the UK.\nThe problem was that excess fluff could catch the heating element in the machine and cause a fire.\nWhat Whirlpool did next has been the source of furious debate among MPs, consumer groups and, to a degree, the company itself.\nMajor companies with various sites in the UK have a home authority trading standards department with whom they work on product safety. In Whirlpool's case this was Peterborough Council's Trading Standards team. \nWhirlpool and Peterborough Trading Standards agreed on a repair campaign to modify the dangerous products, instead of a full product recall.\nHad Whirlpool decided on the latter, customers would have been given a refund, a replacement or a partial refund for older models. In all likelihood owners would have been told to stop using these dryers completely. Action would be required fast.\nThe repair programme that was instigated has received massive criticism, with cases of people being told they must wait well over a year for an engineer to visit.\nAndy Slaughter, the Labour MP for Hammersmith, says that choosing a modification programme created a massive logistical task for Whirlpool, but is evidence that the company wanted control of the process.\nHe condemned Whirlpool's response to the safety risk as a whole as operating \"under the radar\". \n\"If this wasn't so dangerous, I'd have some sympathy for [Whirlpool],\" he says.\nThat danger was made spectacularly clear with a \n in Shepherd's Bush in August. Flames ripped up the side of the building, 100 families were evacuated, and 50 people spent the night away from their homes.\nSome of those families are still unable to return to their damaged flats. \n found the fire clearly started in a tumble dryer.\nMr Slaughter points out that the Defreitas family - in whose seventh-floor flat the fire started - was following Whirlpool's instructions. The company has said the affected tumble dryers can still be used, but should not be left unattended.\nThe victims in this case are not the only ones in disbelief that these products were not recalled.\nEmma McGrath, whose Hotpoint dryer caught fire and left the kitchen of her home in Ayrshire as \"one big black room\", says the appliances should be recalled fearing for others who may use these dryers at night.\nExactly how the decision was made to undertake a repair programme, rather than a recall, has been extremely difficult to establish.\nThe company's risk assessment of the fire hazard of these tumble dryers has not been published.\nFor six months, I have attempted to gain access to correspondence between Whirlpool and Peterborough Council's Trading Standards department in a bid to shed some light on the deliberations. The two parties have very different levels of resources, according to Mr Slaughter, but was any pressure put on local officials by the international corporation?\nTwice my request under Freedom of Information laws was refused. On one occasion the few pages of correspondence that the council said it would consider releasing were described as of \"little or no value\".\nFinally, following an appeal to the Information Commissioner, I was sent 140 pages of correspondence between the two. Some were mundane, many were redacted. At times page after page in a row were entirely black.\nHowever, what some of the correspondence does convey is a keenness from Whirlpool to publicise the fact that there would be no recall.\nOne email reads: \"...one further question from the Whirlpool side if I may - is there a way at all of possibly weaving into this sentence in any way that: 'this is not a recall campaign...\"\nAnother calls for some agreed wording that states \"this activity is correctly a REPAIR campaign and not a RECALL...\"\nSome wording is agreed, but trading standards stress that this may only be used in conjunction with a general explanation of its officers' advisory role.\nIt is understood that, legally, the trading standards department would not be able to order a recall owing to the small number of fires in proportion to the total number of \"at risk\" machines.\nThey would potentially have had to prove in court that the repair programme was an insufficient response. \nOther documents released by the council cover email discussions about the possibility of meetings with Whirlpool's global product safety director who was retiring, and his replacement.\nA batch shows trading standards teams keen to help vulnerable customers. One, for example, prompts an engineer visit as a priority after it is pointed out that an owner is receiving end-of-life care with 24-hour oxygen and cannot leave the house without the help of paramedics.\nA worried family member writes in March: \"We could not bear to imagine what would happen if a fire from this product was to occur, which my dad has explained to Hotpoint, but to no avail as he was told it would still be around July time before they could come and fix the faulty item.\n\"Obviously my father is extremely worried and upset about this as with my mum's illness he has to do at least two loads of washing a day.\"\nUltimately, whatever the information that has been released, there is a great deal that remains blocked from our view. That includes the risk assessment conducted by Whirlpool.\nThe explanation for this is that the information was shared on a purely confidential basis and that placing it into the public domain would \"have a significant reputational impact on Whirlpool and would prejudice Whirlpool's commercial interests on a number of levels\".\nMoreover, Peterborough Council says that disclosing confidential information could deter Whirlpool and other companies from voluntarily raising safety concerns of other products with trading standards officers.\nSo, without information such as a risk assessment being available, it has fallen on some of those dealing with the fires to raise concerns and challenge Whirlpool's advice. \nThey have included the fire service which, through the Local Government Association, has urged owners of these tumble dryers to unplug the dryers and stop using them, arguing that they are \"unwittingly playing Russian roulette\".\nFollowing the Shepherd's Bush investigation, Dave Brown, the London Fire Brigade's director of operations, said: \"This fire has highlighted just how dangerous faulty white goods can be. Disappointingly though, Whirlpool have still not changed their advice to consumers.\n\"We are now appealing once again for them to change their advice and bring it into line with our own. Thankfully there were no serious injuries in the Shepherd's Bush fire but we may not be so lucky if it happens again.\"\nEven within trading standards there have been calls for the government to get involved. Leon Livermore, chief executive of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute, told the BBC that central government had powers to \"force people into recalls\" and that it should \"take action before someone dies\".\nConsumer group Which? has also entered the debate, demanding government action, as has the Business Select Committee, which has demanded more explanation from Whirlpool.\nMost recently, Consumer Minister Margot James has accepted that more action is needed from Whirlpool to reassure the public. Previously, she had said that Whirlpool's repair programme was a \"creditable performance\" and that the company was making a \"concerted effort\" to deal with the safety of appliances. She was also told that recalls generally only have a 10% to 20% success rate.\nYet, during \n, she said: \"Although statistically the risk of the 5 million machines that have been sold may be very low, people have been killed by them.\"\nShe later corrected this statement, saying that some people have been \"seriously affected and some have lost their homes\".\nUnder pressure from MPs and following a review of the system of recalls, she has promised action within weeks on white goods' safety through a new working group on product recalls and safety. This will take over the work of an industry-led steering group which was expecting to report back in two years' time.  \nThe membership of the new group has yet to be announced.\nThroughout it all Whirlpool has retained a consistent line.\n\"The safety of consumers is our number one priority and we are committed to doing everything we can to ensure that the tumble dryer modification programme is carried out in a safe and timely manner. We continue to co-operate fully with the relevant regulatory authority as progress of the campaign is regularly monitored and reviewed,\" it says.\nIt adds that it has increased the number of engineers dealing with these repairs and is offering replacements at a discounted price.

The FAA recently found a potential risk that Boeing must mitigate.\"\nA source familiar with the situation told the BBC: \"\"During simulator testing last week at Boeing, FAA test pilots discovered an issue that affected their ability to quickly and easily follow the required recovery procedures for runaway stabiliser trim (ie, to stop stabilisers on the aircraft's tail moving uncontrollably).\n\"The issue was traced to how data is being processed by the flight computer.\"\nLast month, the FAA indicated that approval of Boeing's changes to the 737 Max could come in late June. That would have allowed test flights in early July. \nThere were initial hopes among airlines that the 737 Max would be back in the air during the summer, but that timetable was pushed back to late this year even before the latest news.   \nReuters, which first reported the new issue, said during an FAA pilot simulation in which the software was activated, it had taken longer than expected to recover the aircraft.\nOther sources said the problem was linked to the aircraft's computing power and whether the processor possessed enough capacity to keep up. \nBoeing said \"we are working closely with the FAA to safely return the Max to service\" and that it believed a software fix would address the problem. \nBut the FAA will be looking into whether it is a hardware issue.\nIf regulators are unsatisfied with the software fix, the microprocessor unit will have to be replaced and the grounding may stretch on for months longer than previously thought.  \nThe loss of Ethiopian flight ET302 in March was the second fatal accident involving a 737 Max in the space of five months. A near identical aircraft, owned by the Indonesian carrier Lion Air, went down in the sea off Jakarta in October 2018.\nThe news that the FAA has found a \"potential risk\" in software developed for the 737 Max should come as no surprise.\nFirstly, fixing the plane is clearly not a simple process. Boeing has been working on the issue for the past eight months - and if a quick and easy solution had been available, perhaps the second of the two accidents could have been avoided. \nMeanwhile, the regulator itself is under intense pressure and its credibility is at stake. Its own actions certifying the aircraft and its relationship with Boeing have come under fierce scrutiny. \nIn deciding whether the aircraft is safe to fly again, it needs to be absolutely rigorous - and needs to be seen to be rigorous as well. \nThere's a great deal at stake here. The longer the 737 Max remains grounded, the more the costs will mount up, for Boeing and for the airlines which were counting on using the new plane. \nBut 346 lives have already been lost, and no-one - not Boeing, not the airlines and not the regulator - can afford another accident. \nPreliminary reports into both accidents have suggested they were triggered by a flight control system deploying at the wrong time, due to a faulty sensor.\nThe FAA has been \n and the certification process that cleared the Max to fly.\nEarlier this month, Capt Chesley Sullenberger, whose landing of a crippled aircraft on New York's Hudson River was turned into a Hollywood film, told a Congressional hearing into the 737 Max that the \"crashes are demonstrable evidence that our current system of design and certification has failed us\".\nAirlines, regulatory authorities and equipment makers met in Montreal on Wednesday to discuss the Boeing 737 Max situation, a gathering organised by industry trade group the International Air Transport Association (IATA).\nFollowing the meeting, IATA director general Alexandre de Juniac said: \"The Boeing 737 Max tragedies weigh heavily on an industry that holds safety as its top priority.\n\"We trust the Federal Aviation Administration, in its role as the certifying regulator, to ensure the aircraft's safe return to service. And we respect the duty of regulators around the world to make independent decisions on FAA's recommendations.\n\"At the same time, aviation is a globally integrated system that relies on global standards, including mutual recognition, trust, and reciprocity among safety regulators. \n\"Aviation cannot function efficiently without this co-ordinated effort, and restoring public confidence demands it.\"", "topic": "business", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/B721/production/_107218864_boeing1.jpg"}, {"title": "Vaginal bacteria linked to ovarian cancer", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/health-48919985?intlink_from_url=&", "content": "Having too few \"friendly\" vaginal bacteria may increase a woman's chance of ovarian cancer, and swabs can be used to spot this, say researchers. \nThe team, led by University College London, hope the finding could be used to identify women at high risk of the cancer, which has no screening test.\nHowever, they say that more work is needed to explore this.\nIt is too soon to recommend women should be given protective doses of the good bacteria, they say.\nThe work, which is published in \n, was funded by money from the government's \n, as well as grants from the EU and the Eve Appeal charity. \nMore than 7,300 women are diagnosed with ovarian cancer each year in the UK. \nDiagnosing it early improves the chances of successful treatment, but the symptoms - bloating and discomfort - can be mistaken for more common, less serious conditions, such as menstrual cramps or irritable bowel syndrome. \nMany women are not diagnosed until the cancer has already started to spread. \nIf your doctor thinks your symptoms could be due to ovarian cancer they will recommend blood tests and scans. \nThe exact cause of ovarian cancer is unknown, but certain factors increase a woman's risk: age, a family history of ovarian or breast cancer and being overweight. \nNow researchers believe micro-organisms living inside our bodies may also play a role.\nThere is growing scientific evidence that the community of bacteria and other microbes that reside inside us - our microbiome - influence our wellbeing and health. \nOne species of beneficial bacteria that is thought to be particularly important in the vagina is called lactobacillus. \nExperts believe it stops other unhelpful or bad microbes from taking up residence and causing harm.\nThe study involved 176 women with ovarian cancer, 109 with inherited high-risk genes for ovarian cancer (BRCA1 genes) and 295 women with no known genetic risk. \nThe women were examined and samples taken using the same collection method used in cervical screening. \nLactobacilli levels were significantly lower in the women under 50 with ovarian cancer or high-risk cancer genes.\nIt is not clear whether this link is causal or if other factors might explain it, or how much of an impact it has on risk.\nHelen Callard, from Cancer Research UK, said: \"The microbiome is a really interesting area of research and we're slowly putting pieces together about how our natural bacteria might affect our health. But when interpreting research like this, association doesn't mean causation. \n\"There are several factors that could influence the risk of ovarian cancer, and different things that can affect the make-up of vaginal bacteria - and it's not always easy to separate these elements. So we need to know how vaginal bacteria might directly affect the risk of developing ovarian cancer. Or whether it's a different factor entirely.\"\nAlexandra Holden, from Target Ovarian Cancer, said: \"Before women become concerned about the bacteria in their vagina, more research is required to better understand how the vaginal microbiome may contribute to ovarian cancer, and find better ways to detect the disease. In the meantime, it is crucial for women to be aware of the symptoms, and to visit the GP with any concerns.\"\nThe investigators believe good bugs provide a protective barrier to other infections, stopping them from travelling up the gynaecological tract to the fallopian tubes and ovaries.\nResearcher Prof Martin Widschwendter said: \"We do not yet know for sure whether low levels of the beneficial bacteria leads to an increased risk of ovarian cancer, but that is what we suspect. \n\"It fits with other research. It's been shown that women who use excessive vaginal hygiene products have lower levels of this bacterium too, and they are at increased risk of ovarian cancer.\"", "topic": "health", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/15FAE/production/_107803009_gettyimages-1137547366.jpg"}, {"title": "Baidu chief doused with water at AI event", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48854213", "content": "The chief executive of Chinese tech giant Baidu has been doused with water during a speech about artificial intelligence (AI).\nRobin Li, co-founder of the firm, was mid-presentation when a man walked on to the stage, grabbed his arm and emptied a bottle of water on his head.\nThe incident happened at the Baidu Create 2019 conference in Beijing.\nAmong the announcements was the news that the firm's smart speaker can now be activated without a \"wake word\".\nThis means the device can respond to users' commands automatically.\nAfter Mr Li was drenched with water, he was heard to say, \"What's your problem?\" as he wiped liquid from his face.\nThe man who took to the stage gave no indication of why he poured the water on Mr Li.\nA spokesman for Baidu told BBC News the firm was not aware of any reason behind the drenching.\nThey added that the matter was now being handled by police.\nBaidu is China's top search provider and \n over the quality of its internet search results.\n following the death of a student who tried an experimental cancer therapy he found online.\nThe student's family said at the time that he found the therapy via Baidu.\nMr Li has also faced scrutiny from investors recently, after the company reported its first ever quarterly loss since becoming a publicly traded firm.\nFollowing his drenching, Mr Li pressed on with his talk.\n\"As you can see, all kinds of unexpected things may happen on our way forward in AI development,\" said Mr Li a moment later.

But will this be enough to offset the growing demand for air travel?\nThis week's Paris Airshow saw the launch of the world's first commercial all-electric passenger aircraft - albeit in prototype form. \nIsraeli firm Eviation says the craft - called Alice - will carry nine passengers for up to 650 miles (1,040km) at 10,000ft (3,000m) at 276mph (440km/h). It is expected to enter service in 2022.\nAlice is an unconventional-looking craft: powered by three rear-facing pusher-propellers, one in the tail and two counter-rotating props at the wingtips to counter the effects of drag. It also has a flat lower fuselage to aid lift. \n\"This plane looks like this not because we wanted to build a cool plane, but because it is electric,\" says Eviation's chief executive Omer Bar-Yohay.\n\"You build a craft around your propulsion system. Electric means we can have lightweight motors; it allows us to open up the design space.\" \nEviation has already received its first orders. US regional airline Cape Air, which operates a fleet of 90 aircraft, has agreed to buy a \"double-digit\" number of the aircraft.\nThe firm is using Siemens and magniX to provide the electric motors, and magniX chief executive Roei Ganzarski says that with two billion air tickets sold each year for flights of under 500 miles, the business potential for small electric passenger aircraft is clear. \nCrucially, electricity is much cheaper than conventional fuel. \nA small aircraft, like a turbo-prop Cessna Caravan, will use $400 on conventional fuel for a 100-mile flight, says Mr Ganzarski. But with electricity \"it'll be between $8-$12, which means much lower costs per flight-hour\".\n\"We're not an environmentalist company, the reason we're doing this is because it makes business sense.\" \nMagniX is now working with seaplane operator, Vancouver-based Harbour Air, to start converting their existing fleet to electric.\nThe future also looks reasonably bright when it comes to medium-range flight - a range of up to about 1,500km. \nUnlike Alice, aircraft targeting this range would use a mix of conventional and electric power, enabling them to cut CO2 emissions significantly by switching on the electrical component of their propulsion at the key points in a flight - take-off and landing.\nSeveral demonstration projects are now nearing fruition. \nFor example, Rolls-Royce, Airbus and Siemens are working on the E-Fan X programme, which will have a two megawatt (2MW) electric motor mounted on a BAE 146 jet. It is set to fly in 2021.\n\"There are huge amounts of energy involved here, the engineering is absolutely leading-edge - and our investment in electrification is ramping up rapidly,\" says Rolls-Royce's chief technology officer Paul Stein.\nUnited Technologies, which includes engine-maker Pratt & Whitney in its portfolio, is working on its Project 804, a hybrid electric demonstrator designed to test a 1MW motor and the sub-systems and components required. \nThe firm says it should provide fuel savings of at least 30%. It should fly in 2022 and is forecast to be ready for regional airliners by the mid-2020s.\nZunum Aero, backed by Boeing, is using a engine turbine from France's Safran to power an electric motor for a hybrid craft. And low-cost airline EasyJet is working with Wright Electric, saying it will start using electric aircraft in its regular services by 2027. This is likely to be on short-haul flights, such as London to Amsterdam - Europe's second busiest route.\n\"Electric flying is becoming a reality and we can now foresee a future that is not exclusively dependent on jet fuel,\" says EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren.\nIt's a statement underscored by a report from investment bank UBS which predicts the aviation sector will quickly switch to hybrid and electric aircraft for regional travel, with an eventual demand for 550 hybrid airliners each year between 2028 and 2040.\nBut the prospects for electric long-haul flights are not so rosy.\nWhile electrical motors, generators, power distribution and controls have advanced very rapidly, battery technology hasn't.\nEven assuming huge advances in battery technology, with batteries that are 30 times more efficient and \"energy-dense\" than they are today, it would only be possible to fly an A320 airliner for a fifth of its range with just half of its payload, says Airbus's chief technology officer Grazia Vittadini.\n\"Unless there is some radical, yet-to-be invented paradigm shift in energy storage, we are going to rely on hydrocarbon fuels for the foreseeable future,\" says Paul Eremenko, United Technologies chief technology officer.\nThe big problem with this is that 80% of the aviation industry's emissions come from passenger flights longer than 1,500km - a distance no electric airliner could yet fly.\nYet the UK has become the first G7 country to accept the goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050 - a huge challenge for the air travel business with 4.3 billion tickets sold this year and eight billion expected to be sold by 2037.\nRegulators are also piling on the pressure. \nIn Europe, the European Aviation Safety Agency says it will start categorizing aircraft based on their CO2 emissions, while Norway and Sweden are aiming to make short-haul flights in their airspace electric by 2040.\nSo logically, is the only answer is to ditch long-haul flights?\nThis obviously isn't an appealing prospect for the industry. Rolls-Royce's Paul Stein says starkly that the world would be in a \"dark place\" if we stopped travelling. \nHe argues that in a global economy \"where peaceful co-existence comes about from travelling and understanding each other, if we move away from that I am very concerned it's not the direction mankind should be going in\".", "topic": "business", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/15CEF/production/_107472398_uktwyjna.jpg"}, {"title": "Ryanair expects to win in airline 'fare wars'", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48332849", "content": "Ryanair chief Michael O'Leary has said he expects the airline to benefit from any price war in the industry.\nMr O'Leary said \"artificially low prices\" and \"attritional fare wars\" could dent profits for a year or two.\nHe was speaking after the airline reported that profits fell by nearly a third last year to \u20ac1bn (\u00a3880m) because fuel costs rose and fares fell. \nProfits at Europe's biggest discount airline might also be lower this year, as fares could fall by up to 2%.\nFor last year, Ryanair's average one-way fare was \u20ac37, down 6%, although this was offset by spending on services such as hotels and car hire.\nFor the current financial year, the carrier said it was \"cautious\" on pricing and had \"zero\" visibility for the second half of the year.\nIt said that while bookings in the first half of this year were slightly ahead of last year, \"fares are lower and we expect this trend will continue through 2019\".\nMr O'Leary said: \"Frankly, if we are in a period where there's going to be attritional fare wars for a year or two that's good for Ryanair... as... we have the lowest cost base... profits will suffer for a year or two and I think that is what our shareholders should expect.\n\"However it is clear in my mind that within the next four to five years you are seeing the emergence of four or five large European airline groups,\" he said.\nHe referred to Ryanair, Lufthansa, IAG (owner of British Airways), Air France-KLM and, probably, Easyjet.\nMergers of other airlines would lead to \"some upward pressure on pricing,\" he said.\n\"[Fares] will begin to rise again because they are artificially low at the moment,\" Mr O'Leary said.\nDespite a 7% increase in passenger numbers, earlier this year Ryanair was named the UK's least-liked short-haul airline for the sixth year running in a survey by consumer body Which?.\nNeil Sorahan, Ryanair's chief financial officer, told the BBC that the airline did not spend too much time worrying about surveys and that the most important thing was being on time.\n\"Our customers enjoyed an average fare of \u20ac37 which was down 6% on last year.

part of a faecal stool is taken from one person and given to another.\nThe purpose is to introduce new beneficial microbes to the receiving patient's digestive system.\nAnd it can be life-saving. \nIt shows just how important microbes, which colonise nearly every surface of our body, are to our health. \nThe gut is an exceptionally rich world with many different species of micro-organisms interacting with each other and our human tissue. \nDown in the dark, oxygen-deprived depths of your bowels is an ecosystem as rich as a rainforest or coral reef. \nBut a bacterium called \n (\n) can take over and dominate the bowels.\nIt is an opportunist and normally takes hold after patients have been treated with antibiotics. \nAntibiotic drugs are one of the miracles of the modern age, but they kill good and bad bacteria alike. \nThey are like a forest fire burning through the gut's microbiome - the collected micro-organisms living down there - leaving behind a scorched microbial earth on which \n flourishes.\nThe problem with \n is that patients will have multiple bouts of watery and even bloody diarrhoea every day, tummy cramps, fever and in the most severe cases the infection is  fatal.\nThe best that medicine has to offer is more antibiotics; it is the definition of a vicious circle. \nA stool transplant - or to give it its full title \"a faecal microbiota transplant\" - aims to repopulate the patient's gut with the microbes from a healthy person. \nA relative is often used as they would have had similar gut bacteria. \nAfter a \"sample\" is produced, it is mixed with water. \nSome techniques break the poo up by hand while others blitz it in a household blender. \nThere are two routes for getting the sample into the required location - down through the mouth or up through the rectum. \n on BBC Radio 4.\nDr Janet Jansson, a microbial ecologist from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Washington State in the US, was part of the team trying to prove trans-poo-sion works. \nThe patient was a 61-year-old woman who had had chronic diarrhoea for around eight months and had lost 27kg in weight. \n\"It was really a desperate plea for some kind of solution, she was at risk of dying from this \n infection, all of the antibiotics were ineffective,\" said Dr Jansson.\nA sample of healthy stool was transplanted from her husband.\nDr Jansson told the BBC she was very surprised at its success.\n\"Amazingly two days after that she was able to have normal stools, normal bowel movements, she was basically cured,\" she said.\n\"As a microbial ecologist, this is very unusual. \n\"We saw she went from a very diseased state, when you look at the microbial species, to a healthy microbiome that was very similar to her husband's,\" Dr Jansson added.\nTrials have suggested the procedure is \n.\nThe excitement in the field has led to some people even performing their own DIY faecal transplants with groups like OpenBiome in the US - essentially a public stool bank - being set up.\nBut will trans-poo-sions mean anything for medicine beyond \n?\nThe interaction between our human and microbial selves is being investigated in nearly every disease you can think of. \nThe microbiome has been linked to diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, Parkinson's, whether cancer drugs work and even depression and autism.\nBut this means there could be unintended consequences of a faecal transplant. \nThere was a report in 2015 of a woman gaining 36lb (16kg) and \n after a transplant from her daughter. \nIt is possible to make mice thinner or fatter by transplanting into them the microbiome from either a lean or obese human, although the jury is still out on whether the same rules apply in people. \nThere is also the more obvious risk of transferring dangerous disease-causing microbes. \nIt is why scientists are trying to move on from donating faeces to donating cocktails of bacteria. \nDr Trevor Lawley, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said future treatments had to be more refined and targeted.\n\"Faeces is an undefined community, and when you develop a drug first and foremost you have to consider the safety of the patient,\" he said.\n\"We have an idea of what bugs to put in now, so if you have a defined mixture that's proven safe, we can overcome that.\" \nAnd that is likely to be the future of microbial medicine -

Thankfully a growing number of producers are now eliminating waste water altogether.\nSaitex International, a jeans manufacturer based in Vietnam, is one such business. Its factory, located 30km (19 miles) outside of Ho Chi Minh City, now recycles 98% of the water it uses. For the remaining 2% it has an evaporation system, making it a zero discharge facility.\nOwner Sanjeev Bahl says that before setting up the factory in 2010 he \"started looking at sanitation, or inadequate sanitation, globally, and the lack of clean drinking water\".\n\"Morally it pushed us to start looking at water as a very valuable resource.\"\nWith 5,000 employees, Saitex makes denim clothing lines for brands including J Crew, G-Star Raw and Everlane. Mr Bahl says it took the company just six years to earn back the money it invested in the water recycling technology.\n\"What we realised is that it's not just mission orientated,\" he says. \"If you do it right, it can be financially beneficial as well.\"\nSome of the big name jeans firms are also working hard to reduce their environmental impact.

In essence, they didn't need to know,\" he says.\nHe says that with vital software, it is essential that the operators - the pilots in this case - understand what is happening and are able to take over control from the autonomous system if necessary.\nHis colleague Dr Ana MacIntosh says there is a wider issue with understanding what is going on inside all sorts of complex AI systems.\n\"The 'explainability' of the decisions which are being taken by systems is very different to having a conversation with a human who previously might have made those decisions,\" she says.\n\"We don't understand in many cases how those decisions are being made.\"\nSmart machines are playing a bigger role in everything from healthcare to air safety - but they are bringing with them new ethical dilemmas.", "topic": "technology", "thumbnail": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.283.03340/img/correspondents/circles/rorycellanjones.png"}, {"title": "Norwegian Air chief executive Bj\u00f8rn Kjos steps down", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48947853", "content": "The chief executive and co-founder of Norwegian Air Shuttle, Bj\u00f8rn Kjos, has stepped down after 17 years in charge at the airline.\nUnder the leadership of Mr Kjos, aged 72, Norwegian Air developed from a small domestic airline into Europe's third biggest low-cost carrier.\nIt also broke into the transatlantic market with low fares. \nHowever, the firm has struggled to make profits and has also been hit by the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane.\nNorwegian has 18 of the aircraft and on Thursday said that it did not expect them to return to service until October, later than its previous estimate of August.\nThe airline said the grounding could cost as much as 700m Norwegian kroner (\u00a365m; $82m) this year, and could also undo its plan to return to profitability.\nThe 737 Max fleet of jets was grounded after two crashes, the first a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea off Jakarta last year, and the second an Ethiopian Airlines' flight which crashed shortly after take off from Addis Ababa in March. In total 346 people were killed.\nNorwegian's low fares have allowed it to grow rapidly. Last year it launched 35 new routes, carried more than 37 million passengers and added 2,000 staff.\nIts big innovation has been to operate low-cost long-haul flights between the UK and the US, which it started in 2014. It now flies to 12 US destinations from London's Gatwick airport.\nIt has become the biggest international carrier to serve the New York City area, carrying more passengers there than British Airways, Air Canada or Lufthansa, \nHowever, that growth has come at the expense of profits.\nThe airline lost 1.45bn kroner last year, which it blamed on fuel costs, tough competition and issues with engines on its Dreamliner aircraft.\nIn March, to shore up its finances, Norwegian raised 1.3bn kroner through a share sale and also sold some aircraft.\nMr Kjos, a former fighter pilot, has pledged to slow the airline's growth and focus on profitability this year.\nHe said that strategy was reflected in the company's second-quarter results, released earlier on Thursday, which show a net profit of 82.8m kroner.\n\"Norwegian's Q2 results show that we are delivering on our strategy of moving from growth to profitability,\" he said.\n\"Despite operational issues outside of our control, like the grounding of our 737 Max fleet, we are delivering the highest second quarter operating revenue in the history of Norwegian.\"\nBj\u00f8rn Kjos was one of the founders of the company. As the man in the pilot's seat since 2002, he was also the driving force behind its expansion from a tiny regional carrier to become a major player in Europe's low-cost market. He also led the move into the long-haul market, using a new generation of efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to offer cheap flights to the US, South America and even Thailand.\nThere was no shortage of passengers, but all of this growth came at a cost.  The airline has billions of dollars' worth of debt and, over the past couple of years, has racked up hefty losses. In March, it was forced to sell new shares in order to raise hundreds of millions of pounds in new funding. It's also had to cut routes and sell some planes. \nThe signs are that this radical action is starting to take effect, giving Mr Kjos the chance to bow out on a positive note. A new leader can now be appointed to guide the company, as it attempts to turn market share into sustainable profits. It won't be easy. As the likes of Monarch, Flybe and Air Berlin have shown, the low-cost market is a harsh environment, where only the fittest survive.\nOf course, there is another option. A new chief executive might be more willing than Mr Kjos to consider a takeover approach - from British Airways' parent IAG, for example.

It was a strong hint that the difference was a result of their micro-organisms.  \n\"We all go back to that first paper for the first wave of neuroscientists considering microbes,\" says Dr Jane Foster, a neuropsychiatrist at McMaster University in Canada.\n\"That really was very powerful for those of us who were studying depression and anxiety.\"\nIt was the first hint of microbial medicine in mental health. \nThe brain is the most complex object in the known universe so how could it be reacting to bacteria in the gut?\nThere is now a rich vein of research linking germ-free mice with changes in behaviour and even the structure of the brain. \nBut their completely sterile upbringing is nothing like the real world. We're constantly coming into contact with microbes in our environment, none of us are germ-free.\nAt Cork University Hospital, Prof Ted Dinan is trying to uncover what happens to the microbiome in his depressed patients. \nA good rule of thumb is a healthy microbiome is a diverse microbiome, containing a wide variety of different species living all over our bodies. \nProf Dinan says: \"If you compare somebody who is clinically depressed with someone who is healthy, there is a narrowing in the diversity of the microbiota.\n\"I'm not suggesting it is the sole cause of depression, but I do believe for many individuals it does play a role in the genesis of depression.\"\nAnd he argues some lifestyles that weaken our gut bacteria, such as a diet low in fibre, can make us more vulnerable.\nIt's an intriguing concept - that an imbalance in the gut microbiome could be involved in depression. \nSo scientists at the APC Microbiome centre, at University College Cork, started transplanting the microbiome from depressed patients to animals. It's known in the biz as a trans-poo-sion. \nIt showed that if you transfer the bacteria, you transfer the behaviour too.\nProf John Cryan told the BBC: \"We were very surprised that you could, by just taking microbiome samples, reproduce many of the features of a depressed individual in a rat.\" \nThis included anhedonia - the way depression can lead to people losing interest in what they normally find pleasurable. \nFor the rats, that was sugary water they could not get enough of, yet \"when they were given the microbiome from a depressed individual, they no longer cared\", says Prof Cryan. \n on BBC Radio 4.\nSimilar evidence - linking the microbiome, the gut and the brain - is emerging in Parkinson's disease. \nIt is clearly a brain disorder. Patients lose control over their muscles as brain cells die and it leads to a characteristic tremor. \nBut Prof Sarkis Mazmanian, a medical microbiologist from Caltech, is building the case that gut bacteria are involved. \n\"Classical neuroscientists would find this as heresy to think you can understand events in the brain by researching the gut,\" he says. \nHe has found \"very powerful\" differences between the microbiomes of people with Parkinson's and those without the disease. \nStudies in animals, genetically hardwired to develop Parkinson's, show gut bacteria were necessary for the disease to emerge. \nAnd when stool was transplanted from Parkinson's patients to those mice, they developed \"much worse\" symptoms than using faeces sourced from a healthy individual. \nProf Mazmanian told the BBC: \"The changes in the microbiome appear to be driving the motor symptoms, appear to be causal to the motor symptoms.\n\"We're very excited about this because it allows us to target the microbiome as an avenue for new therapies.\"\nThe evidence linking the microbiome and the brain is as fascinating as it is early. \nBut the pioneers of this field see an exciting prospect on the horizon - a whole new way of influencing our health and wellbeing. \nIf microbes do influence our brains then maybe we can change our microbes for the better. \nCan altering the bacteria in Parkinson's patients' guts change the course of their disease?\nThere is talk of psychiatrists prescribing mood microbes or psychobiotics - effectively a probiotic cocktail of healthy bacteria - to boost our mental health.\nDr Kirsten Tillisch, at University of California, Los Angeles, told me: \"If we change the bacteria can we change the way we respond?\nBut she says we need far bigger studies that really probe what species, and even sub-species, of bacteria may be exerting an effect on the brain and what products they are making in the gut. \nDr Tillisch said: \"There's clearly connections here, I think our enthusiasm and our excitement is there because we haven't had great treatments. \n\"It's very exciting to think there's a whole new pathway that we can study and we can look and we can help people, maybe even prevent disease.\" \nAnd that's the powerful idea here. \nThe microbiome - our second genome - is opening up an entirely new way of doing medicine and its role is being investigated in nearly every disease you can imagine including allergies, cancer and obesity. \nI've been struck by how malleable the second genome is and how that is in such stark contrast to our own DNA. \nThe food we eat, the pets we have, the drugs we take, how we're born\u2026 all alter our microbial inhabitants. \nAnd if we're doing that unwittingly, imagine the potential of being able to change our microbiome for the better. \nProf Cryan said: \"I predict in the next five years when you go to your doctor for your cholesterol testing etc, you'll also get your microbiome assessed.\n\"The microbiome is the fundamental future of personalised medicine.\"  \nFollow James ", "topic": "health", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/11CA5/production/_100996827_brainandguttoppic_16_9.jpg"}, {"title": "Would you drink camel milk?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48935371", "content": "Would you switch to drinking camel milk? Australia's growing number of camel farmers are hoping to persuade you.\nIt's not unusual for the owners of a small, close-knit business to treat their workers as an extension of their family.\nOf course those members of staff aren't usually of the four-legged, one-humped variety.\nLauren Brisbane is the owner of QCamel, Australia's only certified organic commercial camel milk dairy.\nCamel milk production has become one of Australia's emerging agricultural industries, as demand for the product grows both locally and internationally. However, Lauren says her family-owned and run operation isn't driven by commercial influences - it's motivated by love.\n\"We have a different philosophy in how we run our dairy,\" she says of the Queensland-based farm. \n\"It is paramount when running a happy and healthy camel dairy to really understand and respect the camels. We see them as our family members and fellow members of staff, rather than just stock or machinery.\n\"They're like people, they've all got a different personality.

You can sit and talk to them about what's going on, and they completely understand.\n\"They're a huge animal\u2026 but if you respect that kindness and intelligence, they're easy to work with.\"\nIncreasing numbers of Australian farmers are choosing to keep the country's prolific \"ships of the desert\".  The camel was first introduced to Australia in the 1840s to assist in the exploration of the country's vast interior or outback.\nThere are now thought to be more than 1.2 million in the wild, which is considered to be the world's largest feral population. They are mostly the dromedary or Arabian camel, which has one hump, and is the species chosen for milk production.  Australia also has a much smaller wild population of the two humped Bactrian camel.\nAustralia's first camel dairies opened in 2014, and since then the industry has grown considerably, with dairies now operating in almost every state and territory.\nWhile global camel milk production is dominated by countries in North and East Africa, and the Middle East, a 2016 report by the Australian government predicted that \nBack in 2016 the country produced 50,000 litres of camel milk, compared with 180,000 litres per annum today.\nMegan Williams has certainly helped drive that growth. She and her husband Chris set up a dairy in northern Victoria towards the end of 2014, with just three camels from the wild, which they subsequently had to train to be milked.\nFive years later their business - The Camel Milk Co Australia - has moved to a property more than twice the size. They now have a herd of more than 300 camels, with around 60 currently being milked. \nThe farm averages around six litres of milk per camel per day. One third of that is sent overseas to customers in Singapore, with shipments of both fresh and powdered milk about to expand into Thailand and Malaysia.\nChina and the US are on the list of potential future markets for Megan, while other camel milk producers across Australia are exporting to destinations including New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Hong Kong. \n\"We're probably doing a couple of hundred litres for export each week, but with Thailand coming on board, that's set to really increase,\" says Megan.\n\"More often than not, we are approached by international buyers and their markets. One thing Australia has over any other country in the world is our camels are disease-free.\"\nThe disease Megan is referring to is the \n which can break out in camel populations in the Middle East. The virus can spread to humans from contact with camels, or by consuming raw camel milk, and is potentially fatal.\nWhile camel milk has been consumed by humans for more than 6,000 years, worldwide demand has grown markedly in recent years, despite its expensive nature. One litre of pasteurised camel milk retails for about A$15 ($10; \u00a38) in Australia, making it 12 times more expensive than cow's milk.\nThe recent increase in interest in camel milk has been led by consumers seeking the milk's supposed health benefits. On a nutritional level, camel milk is richer than cow's milk in vitamin C, vitamin B, iron, calcium, magnesium and potassium.\nOther properties attributed to camel milk, according to the 2016 Australian Government market assessment, include its \"attributed\" capacity to \"alleviate food and seasonal allergies, usefulness in reducing insulin dependency and the treatment of diabetes, [and] ease of digestion\".\nMore from the \nRebecca Forwood has been importing Australian camel milk into Singapore for almost two years and believes in its benefits.\n\"I hate the term 'superfood', but this really is up there as one of the best,\" she says.\n\"Since selling it ourselves we average about 160-200 one litre bottles a month, and the numbers are growing as more people are discovering its healing benefits.\"\nCharlene Grosse, accredited practising dietician and spokesperson for the Dietitians Association of Australia, says that while camel milk is certainly nutritionally valuable, more research is needed to put some of the other claims to the test.\n\"When you look at camel milk it's just like cow's milk, it is very nutritious,\" she says.\n\"It's low in cholesterol and it's low sugar, so it can be a healthy substitute [to cow's milk], but what we do need to be aware of is there's not enough research at the moment to back up some of the claims being made about camel's milk.\"\nRegardless of the need for more studies Megan says one thing is certain - the future for this unexpected Australian export industry is certainly bright. In addition to milk, the sector is also starting to make cheeses, skincare products, and chocolate made with camel milk.\n\"Every week we get a new contact or a new inquiry, and it just keeps growing.\"\nBut what is camel milk like?

Dr Michael Mosley has been finding out which foods and drinks can make the most difference.  \nThe gut microbiome - the diverse community of bacteria that inhabits our intestines - is a hot topic in science right now.  \nAlmost every day we come across headlines claiming that it has the power to influence our health in new and surprising ways, whether it's our weight, our mood or our ability to resist infection.  \nUnsurprisingly, given this explosion of interest in our inner ecosystem, our supermarket shelves and pharmacies now stock an array of probiotic products - products containing live bacteria and yeasts - that claim to be able to influence our gut microbiome for the better. But is any of this actually possible?  \nTo find out, \n set up an experiment in Inverness with the help of NHS Highland and 30 volunteers and scientists around the country. We split our volunteers into three groups and over four weeks asked each group to try a different approach that, it's claimed, can boost gut bacteria for the better.\nOur first group tried an off-the-shelf probiotic drink of the type found in most supermarkets. These drinks usually contain one or two species of bacteria that can survive the journey through our powerful stomach acid to set up home in our intestines.\nOur second group tried a traditional fermented drink called kefir which contains an array of bacteria and yeast.  \nOur third group was asked to eat foods rich in a prebiotic fibre called inulin. Prebiotics are substances that feed the good bacteria already living in our guts, and inulin can be found in Jerusalem artichokes, chicory root, onions, garlic and leeks.\nWhat we found at the end of our study was fascinating. The group consuming the probiotic drink saw a small change in one bacteria type known to be good for weight management, bacteria called Lachnospiraceae. However this change wasn't statistically significant.\nBut our other two groups did see significant changes.

Doing a good job involved analysing the words on the web pages and logging how many other sites saw that page as definitive.\nNow, said Mr Emmott, searching has got a lot more complicated thanks to our increasingly complicated online and business lives. \nInstead of just looking up web pages, modern life can include finding a date or a soul mate, scoring a second-hand bargain in an auction, calling up instant taxi services or streaming more movies than you could watch in a lifetime of utter sloth.\n\"One way or another if you use applications throughout the day you will be touching a lot of different search engines and services,\" he said.\nThese days, most of those searches will not involve Google technology. Google declined to comment.\nInstead, there are new pretenders to the search crown such as Elastic and Solr. \nSearching in the old days was about typing text. No so today. Searching can involve swiping right, moving a map with your fingers or talking to an app, said Shay Banon, founder of Elastic, which makes the open source search technology used by the likes of Tinder, eBay, Uber, Lyft and Netflix.\nBehind the search box, the mechanics of finding the right answer are very different, he said.\nFor instance, on Tinder when you swipe right on a profile, that is a search in that it involves matching data against a constantly shifting set of parameters. It's just not a search as Google classically defined it.\nUber and Lyft also have to match against location as well as the preferences of both their drivers and riders. Similarly, Netflix and eBay do a lot of number crunching to answer queries and make suggestions for their massive user populations.\nMr Banon wrote the first version of Elastic to help his wife who was studying to be a cordon bleu chef. \n\"I decided to write a recipe app for her and needed to figure out how to add a search box to it to look through all the knowledge she was accumulating,\" he said.\nJust indexing the information in all the recipes, techniques and tricks she was learning was not enough, he said. \n\"I needed a search engine that was highly curated to her experience and her knowledge from the culinary world,\" said Mr Banon.\nThat step involved representing relationships between the different elements and organising the information so it could be queried quickly. \nTinder, for instance, uses Elastic to manage more than 300 million search queries every day.\nAnd just as modern web businesses rely on search to keep them running, almost every business has realised that search is a basic function they have to get right, said Mr Emmott from Gartner.\nThat is for a couple of reasons, he said. Good analysis of customer data, a search in all but name, can reveal important unseen relationships or snags in a sales process that need smoothing out.\nFor organisations such as Netflix and Tinder, organising themselves to find fresh insights is straight-forward, said Haydn Jones, founder of data science firm Alqami and a veteran of large-scale engineering projects. \n\"Netflix, Lyft, Uber and the like started with a blank sheet of paper,\" he said. \nAs a result they could choose what technology to use and did not have to worry about the different bits not working well together because they record data in different formats or according to different protocols.\nThat is a luxury few long-established companies have, he said. \nModern search technologies can help because they are much better at handling different sorts of data and extracting useful information from them - it's rarely just about that big bag of words. \nAnd, he said, it was well worth going through the process to analyse the data and see what squeezing it via search can produce. \nAlqami had helped many organisations realise several new use cases for their data because searching through it more efficiently revealed insights they did not know they had.\n\"Where there is muck there is brass when it comes to data,\" he said.", "topic": "technology", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A370/production/_107804814_041017372-1.jpg"}, {"title": "More than half your body is not human", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43674270", "content": "More than half of your body is not human, say scientists. \nHuman cells make up only 43% of the body's total cell count. The rest are microscopic colonists.\nUnderstanding this hidden half of ourselves - our microbiome - is rapidly transforming understanding of diseases from allergy to Parkinson's.\nThe field is even asking questions of what it means to be \"human\" and is leading to new innovative treatments as a result. \n\"They are essential to your health,\" says Prof Ruth Ley, the director of the department of microbiome science at the Max Planck Institute, \"your body isn't just you\".\nNo matter how well you wash, nearly every nook and cranny of your body is covered in microscopic creatures.\nThis includes bacteria, viruses, fungi and archaea (organisms originally misclassified as bacteria). The greatest concentration of this microscopic life is in the dark murky depths of our oxygen-deprived bowels.\nProf Rob Knight, from University of California San Diego, told the BBC: \"You're more microbe than you are human.\"\nOriginally it was thought our cells were outnumbered 10 to one.  \n\"That's been refined much closer to one-to-one, so the current estimate is you're about 43% human if you're counting up all the cells,\" he says.\nBut genetically we're even more outgunned. \nThe human genome - the full set of genetic instructions for a human being - is made up of 20,000 instructions called genes. \nBut add all the genes in our microbiome together and the figure comes out between two and 20 million microbial genes. \nProf Sarkis Mazmanian, a microbiologist from Caltech, argues: \"We don't have just one genome, the genes of our microbiome present essentially a second genome which augment the activity of our own.  \n\"What makes us human is, in my opinion, the combination of our own DNA, plus the DNA of our gut microbes.\" \n on BBC Radio 4.\nIt would be naive to think we carry around so much microbial material without it interacting or having any effect on our bodies at all. \nScience is rapidly uncovering the role the microbiome plays in digestion, regulating the immune system, protecting against disease and manufacturing vital vitamins. \nProf Knight said: \"We're finding ways that these tiny creatures totally transform our health in ways we never imagined until recently.\"\nIt is a new way of thinking about the microbial world. To date, our relationship with microbes has largely been one of warfare. \nAntibiotics and vaccines have been the weapons unleashed against the likes of smallpox, Mycobacterium tuberculosis or MRSA.\nThat's been a good thing and has saved large numbers of lives.  \nBut some researchers are concerned that our assault on the bad guys has done untold damage to our \"good bacteria\". \nProf Ley told me: \"We have over the past 50 years done a terrific job of eliminating infectious disease. \n\"But we have seen an enormous and terrifying increase in autoimmune disease and in allergy. \n\"Where work on the microbiome comes in is seeing how changes in the microbiome, that happened as a result of the success we've had fighting pathogens, have now contributed to a whole new set of diseases that we have to deal with.\"\nThe microbiome is also being linked to diseases including inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson's, whether cancer drugs work and even depression and autism. \nObesity is another example. Family history and lifestyle choices clearly play a role, but what about your gut microbes? \nThis is where it might get confusing. \nA diet of burgers and chocolate will affect both your risk of obesity and the type of microbes that grow in your digestive tract.\nSo how do you know if it is a bad mix of bacteria metabolising your food in such a way, that contributes to obesity? \nProf Knight has performed experiments on mice that were born in the most sanitised world imaginable. \nTheir entire existence is completely free of microbes.\nHe says: \"We were able to show that if you take lean and obese humans and take their faeces and transplant the bacteria into mice you can make the mouse thinner or fatter depending on whose microbiome it got.\"\nTopping up obese with lean bacteria also helped the mice lose weight. \n\"This is pretty amazing right, but the question now is will this be translatable to humans\"\nThis is the big hope for the field, that microbes could be a new form of medicine. It is known as using \"bugs as drugs\".\nI met Dr Trevor Lawley at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, where he is trying to grow the whole microbiome from healthy patients and those who are ill.\n\"In a diseased state there could be bugs missing, for example, the concept is to reintroduce those.\"\nDr Lawley says there's growing evidence that repairing someone's microbiome \"can actually lead to remission\" in diseases such as ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease.\nAnd he added: \"I think for a lot of diseases we study it's going to be defined mixtures of bugs, maybe 10 or 15 that are going into a patient.\"\nMicrobial medicine is in its early stages, but some researchers think that monitoring our microbiome will soon become a daily event that provides a brown goldmine of information about our health. \nProf Knight said: \"It's incredible to think each teaspoon of your stool contains more data in the DNA of those microbes than it would take literally a tonne of DVDs to store.\n\"At the moment every time you're taking one of those data dumps as it were, you're just flushing that information away. \n\"Part of our vision is, in the not too distant future, where as soon as you flush it'll do some kind of instant read-out and tells you are you going in a good direction or a bad direction. \n\"That I think is going to be really transformative.\"\nFollow James ", "topic": "health", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/1046/production/_100766140_bacteriahuman_replacement.jpg"}, {"title": "Gene-silencing: 'New class' of medicine reverses disease porphyria", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-47907971", "content": "Doctors have used a new type of medicine called \"gene silencing\" to reverse a disease that leaves people in crippling pain. \nThe condition, acute intermittent porphyria, also causes paralysis and is fatal in some cases. \nThe novel approach fine-tunes the genetic instructions locked in our DNA.\nDoctors say they are \"genuinely surprised\" how successful it is and that the same approach could be used in previously untreatable diseases.\nSue Burrell, from Norfolk, has endured pain few could imagine and needed to take strong opioid painkillers every day.\nAt one point her porphyria was causing severe attacks every couple of weeks and needed hospital treatment.\nBut even then morphine did not stop the pain. \nShe told the BBC it was worse than child-birth, saying: \"It's so intense - so strong it's in your legs, in your back, and it just resonates everywhere. It's really, really unbearable.\"\nHer sister was affected even more severely and was completely paralysed in hospital for two years. \nThere are several types of porphyria, but each is caused by the body being unable to produce enough of a substance called haem.\nHaem is a key component of the haemoglobin in red blood cells that transport oxygen around the body. \nProblems in the body's haem manufacturing process can lead to a build up of toxic proteins.\nThese cause the attacks of physical pain in Sue's form of the disease. In other porphyrias the proteins can cause skin problems.\nThere is some speculation \n.\nSue was one of the patients on the trial and is now taking the drug.\nShe says her life has been transformed.\n\"I've had pain for 10 years, I didn't expect that could go away. I'm seeing friends and they're [asking] 'you're not taking any painkillers?' and I was [saying] 'no!'.\"\nA clinical trial on 94 people across 18 countries was presented at the International Liver Congress in Vienna. \nThe therapy cut the number of severe attacks by 74%.\nAnd 50% of patients were completely clear of attacks that needed hospital treatment, compared to 16% given a dummy treatment. \nOne person dropped out of the study due to side effects.\nThe treatment uses an approach called gene silencing. \nA gene is part of our DNA that contains the blueprint for making proteins, such as hormones, enzymes or raw building materials.\nBut our DNA is locked away inside a cell's nucleus and kept apart from a cell's protein-making factories.\nSo our bodies use a short strand of genetic code, called messenger RNA, to bridge the gap and carry the instructions. \nThis drug, called givosiran, kills the messenger in a process known as RNA interference.\nIn acute intermittent porphyria it lowers the levels of an enzyme involved in haem production and prevents the build-up of toxic proteins.\nProf David Rees, from King's College London, treated patients taking part in the trial in the UK. \nHe told the BBC: \"This is a really important treatment - it's innovative. Porphyria is one of the first conditions it has been used in successfully. \n\"I'm genuinely surprised how well it works in this condition and I think it offers a lot of hope for the future.\"\nPotentially yes, but it is still very early days. \nGene silencing has been used to treat a genetic disease that causes nerve damage and the US Food and Drug Administration \n \"have the potential to transform medicine\".\nA similar approach is also being investigated in Huntington's disease, which is caused by a toxic protein that kills brain cells. \nResearchers are also looking into it as an alternative to statins for lowering cholesterol.\nBarry Greene, the president of Alnylam, which developed the porphyria drug, told the BBC the latest findings were \"heralding a brand new class of medicine\". \nThe field of gene silencing has been around for a long time. \n went to the researchers who discovered RNA interference, which occurs naturally in our cells. \nBut the field is now getting to the point where it can be harnessed to help some patients.\nDr Alena Pance, from the Wellcome Sanger Institute, told the BBC News website: \"I get excited about this, because targeting the messenger RNA allows the fine-tuning of the proteins that are involved in certain diseases.\n\"And therefore, perhaps for the first time, [it can] offer a tool to be able to control those diseases to very accurate levels. \n\"There are diseases that are very difficult to find treatment for, that with this technology might be possible to tackle.\"\nKind of. \nGene therapy permanently alters the hard copy of the genetic instructions in DNA. \nThis can be beneficial as it means you need treatment only once, but could also be more risky. If anything goes wrong, such as accidentally editing the wrong part of the genetic code, it cannot be undone.\nGene silencing leaves the original DNA alone, but targets the instructions that it sends out into the cell. \nThe downside is you need to keep taking the treatment for the therapy to work.\nThe two approaches are likely to have roles in different diseases. \nGene therapy has greater potential in diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy where a vital protein for keeping muscles intact is missing. \nGene silencing has more potential where tweaking levels of a protein will affect the course of a disease. \nThis is the million dollar question, almost literally, as so far genetic medicines have been expensive. \nA recent gene therapy for a rare form of blindness \n (\u00a3650,000) for the one-off treatment.\nHow much the monthly injections of givosiran will be is still unknown. \nThe hope will be that as the field develops, the costs will eventually come down.\nFollow James ", "topic": "health", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/F823/production/_106432536_img-20181229-wa0001.jpg"}, {"title": "Obesity 'causes more cases of some cancers than smoking'", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-48826850", "content": "Obesity now causes more cases of four common cancers in the UK than smoking, according to a charity.\nCancer Research UK says bowel, kidney, ovarian and liver cancers are more likely to have been caused by being overweight than by smoking tobacco.\nIt says millions are at risk of cancer because of their weight and that obese people outnumber smokers two to one.\nBut its new billboard campaign highlighting the obesity-cancer risk has been criticised for fat-shaming.\nIt is not the first time the charity has been accused of fat-shaming.\nIn February, comedian and campaigner \n took to Twitter to criticise the campaign.\nOne Twitter user, @KenLynch73, said linking obesity with cigarette-style branding was a new low.\nCancer Research UK says it is not about blaming people for being overweight. \nNor is it suggesting that smoking and obesity are directly comparable in terms of cancer risk.

The app also allows them to donate some of the money they have saved to charity.\nHowever, the more advanced features cost a fee - an extra expense not suffered by parents who pay their children in cash.\nMr Carmichael argues that the charge costs parents far less than swimming or music lessons, but still teaches youngsters a practical life skill.\nThe next step for most youngsters is opening a bank account.

Two margherita pizzas, two glasses of wine, and tip (obligatory everywhere): $96. \nChloe said: \"We are watching the pennies. It's not spoiling our trip... but there are things we thought we'd do that we won't now.\"\nThey'd come to Times Square for discounted tickets for Broadway shows. Even these were too pricey. \"We'll give it a miss this time,\" says Rob, who, like Chloe, did not want his surname used.\nLike tens of thousands of UK tourists, the couple picked an expensive time to visit America. \nThis week sterling hit a more than two-year low against the dollar, trading below $1.25, a rate not seen since April 2017. But these are commercial rates. Tourists get a worse deal when exchanging currency.\nAnd yet, sterling's recent weakness has failed to dent visitor numbers.\nAccording to the US Department of Commerce, 1.8 million Britons visited the US in the five months to 31 May, 8.2% up on the period in 2018. The overwhelming majority were tourists and people visiting friends and family.\nFor 2018 as a whole, 4.7 million visited, up 4% on 2017. This, though, is below the peak year of 2015 when 4.9 million people visited.\nBut analysts doubt the numbers will hold up for the rest of 2019. Indeed, Adam Sacks, president of Philadelphia-based Tourism Economics, thinks the official data over-estimates the picture. \nFor a start, airline passenger growth from the UK to the US is up only 4%, he said. \"Right now, the market [from the UK] is defying gravity.\"\nIt helps that the US is a bucket-list attraction. \"That will always underpin tourism,\" he said.\nBut with sterling facing more headwinds because of Brexit, economic slowdown, and trade wars, \"I'm expecting inbound total traffic for the year to end about 2.5% up on 2018,\" he said.\nIt's not the first time the Strattons, from Hatfield, Hertfordshire, have visited New York, but it's probably the most expensive. \nThey booked their hotel and flight last year, so think they got a better deal than now. \"And we're aware of all the free and discounted attractions that are available,\" says Annette. She advises visitors to do their research and seek these out to save money. \nBut, Richard says: \"Eating out for the four of us is very expensive - $100 a time at least. Sales taxes and tips mean costs soon increase. Even the hotel charges for wifi use.\"\nThey've split some breakfasts and drinks between them to help cut costs. And they had hoped to take in one of Broadway's blockbuster shows - hopefully Hamilton. \"But not at $1,200 for the family,\" said Richard.\nAnnette says that when you're on holiday there's a certain \"pay what it takes\" attitude. And daughters Georgia and Kerensa say they are loving their trip - which as parents know, is what matters most.\nThe girls are especially looking forward to next week, when they visit Florida's amusement parks. Mum, though, thinks it could be even more expensive than New York.\nChris Heywood, an executive at New York's tourist board, NYC & Company, says it would take a sustained and prolonged sterling depression to hit hard the number of UK visitors to his city.\nBritons make up the single biggest group of overseas visitors, with 1.26 million seeing the sites in 2018. The number has grown steadily since 2012, when one million visited.\n\"People are planning their visits better. More come in the first three months of the year, when hotel rates drop,\" he said. His single biggest piece of advice: \"Check our website. There is so much free stuff to do.\" \nIn London, however, Americans are getting slightly more bang for their buck.\nJoy Smith, from Colorado, was in London to meet her daughter, Reilly, who was on the final stop of a six-week European tour with husband Seth before the couple return to Texas.\nJoy said she was expecting prices to be higher but, in fact, the cost of food was \"very comparable\" to prices back home. \nBut the Baycroft family had a different London culinary experience. Johanna, had just bought her son, Cougar, a meal at McDonald's, which she said would have been almost half the price at home in Washington state.\nNevertheless, prices overall were lower than she had budgeted for, although she had prepared for the worst and saved money by staying with her sister.\nBob and Priya were leaving Hamley's with their two daughters, who had bought two teddy bears. The couple were used to New York prices so London \"wasn't a shocker\", Bob said.\nThe EU referendum in June 2016 knocked the value of the pound, making things cheaper for US tourists. Before the vote, $1 was worth around 68 pence. It's now worth about 80p.\nAnd that spurred a big increase in the number of people crossing the Atlantic. The Office for National Statistics recorded a 13% jump in the number of Americans arriving in London in 2017, with 2.6 million visitors spending about \u00a32.2bn - when $1 was worth an average of 81 pence.\nThat helped to offset a slowdown in domestic spending, according to Henry Gregg, from the New West End Company, which represents Central London businesses.\n\"For domestic shoppers, it's bad because they see prices increase,\" he said. But it's good for international shoppers who can take advantage of the \"big pricing differential\" in the short term, he said.\nLuxury brands have been the biggest beneficiaries of the increase in spending by US tourists, Mr Gregg said. Budget retailers like Primark have also benefitted. It's been \"middle of the road\" clothes stores like Topshop that have missed out, he said.\nWhile the number of Americans visiting London increased slightly in 2018, they cut back on spending, forking out \u00a32bn, 8% less than the previous year.\nMr Gregg puts the tightening of purse strings down to a normalisation as retailers increase prices to reflect an increase in costs as a result of an unfavourable exchange rate for importers.\nBut that's not deterring Americans from bringing their tourist dollars to London, according to the New West End Company, which also tracks room bookings - an early indicator of visitor numbers.\nIt said projected visitor numbers would rise 4.8% for June-to-August.\nLondon, like New York, is on the must-see list of most tourists.

If it is detected, audio captured just prior to the wake word as well as what was said immediately afterwards, is transmitted to Amazon's computer servers for processing.\nBecause mistakes are sometimes made, recordings can be transmitted when the wake word is not actually used.\nThe recordings are stored, allowing Amazon to use them to create a model of a user's voice characteristics to help the service learn to adapt to quirks in the different ways different people make requests as well as to provide tailored responses to different users in the home. \nRegistered users can prevent this happening by withdrawing consent. They also have the option to actively train the system to better recognise their voice by repeating a series of phrases.\nHuman operators listen to some of the clips to tag them in order to help the machine-learning system involved become more accurate. \nUsers can delete stored utterances via an app or via Amazon's website. In addition, they can ask Alexa to delete the last recording or last day's worth of recordings via a voice command.\nTwo class action cases are being pursued, one filed in \n and the other in \n.\nThe children are said to have used Alexa to tell jokes, play music, recognise movie references, solve maths problems and answer trivia questions.\nIn both cases, the children had interacted with Echo Dot speakers in their homes, and in both cases the parents claimed they had never agreed for their child's voice to be recorded.\nThe complaints say Alexa devices could have been designed to only send a digital query rather than a voice recording to Amazon's servers - although processing the audio locally would have disadvantages such as potentially driving up the cost of the devices involved and making it harder for Amazon to deploy updates to its voice-recognition tech.\nAlternatively, it is suggested that Amazon could automatically overwrite the recordings shortly after they have been processed, although this might affect the smart assistant's ability to deliver personalised replies.\nEven if neither of these options were adopted, the plaintiffs suggest that more could be done to ensure children and others were aware of what was going on.\n\"At no point does Amazon warn unregistered users it is creating persistent voice recordings of their Alexa interactions, let alone obtain their consent to do so,\" the complaints state.\n\"Neither the children not the parents have consented to the children's interactions being permanently recorded.\"\nAmazon has referred reporters to a blog it published last month \n.\nIt notes that parents can review and delete their offspring's voice recordings at any time via an app or the firm's website. In addition, it says, they can contact the firm and request the deletion of their child's voice profile and any personal information associated with it.\nThe BBC also quizzed the executive in charge of Alexa about the matter last week at the firm's re:Mars conference before the complaints had been filed.\nDave Limp said the firm only profiled under-13s if parents had agreed to its terms of service.\n\"[If] they're 13 and below... then the parent opts in for them,\" he explained.\n\"You have to verify through a parent that the parent themselves has given consent for the child.

The concern is that if people knew for sure that they were playing against a computer, they might play differently.\nBut gamers will only face the algorithm-controlled system if they have first opted in to be part of the experiment. \nThere is a risk that if they lose, then their Match Making Rating (MMR) score will suffer, reducing their ranking against other players and affecting their likelihood of being promoted to higher leagues.\nOne of the UK's leading players said there was a lot of interest among the Starcraft community as to how AlphaStar would perform.\n\"It's a game of hidden information and making decisions with very limited knowledge,\" explained Raza Sekha, from Kent.\n\"People are very curious to see whether DeepMind will innovate and come up with new strategic thoughts.\n\"That would be a really great achievement, but I don't think many people are expecting it to happen.\"\nAlphaStar's predecessors have, however, come up with creative strategies within the games of chess, Go and shogi, which have in turn influenced some of the top human players to change their own tactics.\nThis is not the first time AI researchers have sought to advance the field via video games.\nLast year, San Francisco-based OpenAI reported a breakthrough when it effectively created a \"curious\" agent to achieve high scores \n.\nA range of machine learning experiments have also been carried out within Minecraft, thanks to Microsoft developing \n.\nAnd DeepMind itself rose to prominence by developing agents that taught themselves how to play \n. More recently it created software that plays alongside human team-mates within Quake III Arena.\nThese ready-made virtual environments provide a way to carry out a process called reinforcement learning. This involves agents discovering ways to perform better by themselves via a process of trial and error, receiving \"rewards\" for success rather than being told what to do.\nIn some cases, agents teach themselves from scratch. But in AlphaStar's case, it was first trained to imitate human play by referencing past matches, before being unleashed against other versions of itself to further improve performance.\nAlphaStar's progress has not been without controversy.\nSome players felt that it had an unfair advantage in earlier matches because it could look at a game's entire map at once, taking in more detail than a human could.\n\"As a human, one of the hardest parts of the game is multitasking,\" explained Mr Sekha.\n\"It's really hard to split your attention between two places. \n\"So, an AI has a crucial advantage when it can see everywhere at once, as that lets it attack and defend almost at the same time, whereas a human would have to choose whether it's best to do one or the other.\"\nTo tackle this, the agent has been tweaked to use the game's map more like humans do. It now has to zoom in to a section to determine the action within, and can only move units to locations in view.\nDeepMind has also reduced the number of actions AlphaStar can take per minute to address other criticism. \nBut Mr Sekha said there were still unanswered questions.\n\"If it can switch very quickly from one camera to another camera, much faster than a human could, that would still be a bit unfair,\" he said.\n\"So it will be really interesting to see what steps they have taken to level the playing field, because last time the community felt it was a bit too much in favour of the artificial intelligence.\" \nDeepMind intends to share more details about the project as part of a scientific research paper, but has yet to determine when it will be published.", "topic": "technology", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/3C71/production/_107837451_6bb836ce-b83e-46e6-9be5-a760569f7b0c.jpg"}, {"title": "Sir James Dyson buys Singapore's 'biggest penthouse flat'", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48932334", "content": "Sir James Dyson has bought what is thought to be Singapore's biggest and most expensive penthouse flat.\nThe purchase comes after his company, best known for its vacuum cleaners, moved its HQ from the UK to Singapore.\nSir James, a prominent advocate for Brexit who has said leaving the EU with no deal would \"make no difference\", was accused of hypocrisy after the move.\nThe property is at the heart of the city's business district and spans three floors and has five bedrooms.\nOfficial records show Sir James and his wife Lady Deirdre Dyson are joint tenants of the apartment at the prestigious Wallich Residence.\n\"Given the decision to locate the headquarters in Singapore and the growing focus of the company's business in the region, of course James Dyson has bought a property there,\" a Dyson spokesperson said in a statement.\nSir James took ownership of the property in June, the records show.  \n, the property is the largest \"non-landed residence\" in Singapore and has its own swimming pool, jacuzzi room and bar facilities.\nSingapore's Business Times reports Sir James paid $73.8m Singapore dollars ($54m, \u00a343m) for the \"super penthouse\", which has views of the city's Marina Bay Sands and the financial district.\nThe price tag is likely to make it Singapore's most expensive flat.\nThe company has said moving its headquarters to Singapore was for commercial reasons, and had nothing to do with Brexit.\n\"It's to make us future-proof for where we see the biggest opportunities,\" chief executive Jim Rowan said at the time.\nDyson has been building its presence in Singapore, announcing last year \n there. \nAs well as vacuum cleaners, Dyson is also known for making air purifiers and hair care products like hair dryers.\nMost of Dyson's products are designed in the UK, but manufactured in Asia.", "topic": "business", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/17AC1/production/_107816969_dyson.penthouse.owner.jpg"}, {"title": "Eye cancer: My proton beam therapy diary", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48950937", "content": "I can't say I was looking forward to my course of treatment for an ocular melanoma. A week of radiotherapy does not sound like a holiday.\nBut the five days I spent earlier this month at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre in Wirral, proved both fascinating and more positive than I could have expected.\nThe cancer hospital sprawls over a large site. But tucked away in a small pleasant building at the back is the National Centre for Eye Proton Therapy.\nIt is the only place in the UK providing this specialised form of treatment for what is a rare cancer.\nEvery year, about seven out of every million people are diagnosed with a choroidal melanoma.\nIn the UK, that is about 500 people a year who develop the malignant tumour behind the eye.\nThere are various forms of treatment for this cancer, including the insertion of a radioactive plaque behind the eye.\nThat was how I was treated at Moorfields Hospital, in London, in 2005, when I was first diagnosed.\nBut, increasingly, the merits of proton beam therapy have been recognised. \nIt involves very precise targeting of the tumour and now nearly half of those diagnosed each year end up being sent to Clatterbridge.\nFor me, the process began about a month ago, with an operation under general anaesthetic at Moorfields.\nThe doctors put markers in my eye for the proton beam team to aim at. \nThis operation turned out to be the most unpleasant part of the whole process.\nThen, a couple of weeks before my treatment, I went to Clatterbridge to have a mask fitted. \nA plan was drawn up involving very precise measurements.\nTreatment week started with a day of final preparations so that everyone was clear about the exact dimensions of the tumour and the plan to zap it over the following four days.\nThe centre involves a remarkable collaboration between ophthalmic oncologists, radiographers and nuclear physicists.\nAt the heart of it is the cyclotron that produces the protons. \nOn the Monday - when no beaming was taking place - I was given a tour.\nThis involved wearing protective clothing and a radiation dosimeter before entering the concrete bunker next door to the treatment room.\nSenior physicist Andrzej Kacperek, who has been here since before the centre opened in the late 1980s, was my guide.\nHe told me that what I was seeing was much like the particle accelerator at Cern, albeit on a smaller scale - a kind of small hadron collider.\n\"Except it's colliding with your eye,\" Dr Kacperek said.\nThe idea behind proton beam therapy is the energy can be targeted so it travels a very precise distance into the body and then stops.\nThat means it can attack the tumour without damaging surrounding tissue and organs. \nSo, in the case of eye treatment, it is often possible to avoid causing loss of sight.\nOn Tuesday, it was the first day of actual beam treatment.\nAfter anaesthetic drops had been put in my eye, I was placed in a highly engineered chair - I'm told it costs several hundred thousand pounds.\nMy personal mask was fitted and the chair was turned and manoeuvred into position in front of what looked like the end of a telescope.\nA few X-rays were taken. Then, as I stared at a red light, a siren went off and the team retired from the treatment room to their mission control, where they monitored my eye on the screens.\nThen, there was a new tone and what appeared to be a blue light as the beaming began. It continued for exactly 31 seconds. \nThen, the team returned to release me from the mask and the machine - and I was free to go. \nExactly the same routine was repeated on the following three days.\nAfter some trepidation at first, and the mild discomfort of having to sit absolutely still, I quickly found the treatment was painless.\nThe hugely professional team of radiographers and physicists were wonderfully reassuring, explaining exactly what was going on at each stage. They dealt sympathetically with any anxieties I had.\nI was helped by the fact I was filming a video diary of my treatment, with the enthusiastic cooperation of the staff. \nDr Kacperek even wielded the camera at one stage, gathering some vital shots for my video. \nThe NHS pays for the dozen or so patients who are treated each week to be put up at a local hotel. \nWe began to recognise each other returning from the hospital, wearing a temporary eye patch until the anaesthetic wore off.\nWe were a diverse bunch: a builder from Cumbria, an accountant from Glasgow, a retired woman in her 80s from Cheltenham, all affected by this rare condition. \nAs the week wore on, a camaraderie built up as we compared notes over breakfast and wished each other good luck with the day's appointment with the beam.\nOn Friday, there was an end-of-term feeling as we headed off for our final appointments.\nI emerged from mine with my eye mask as a souvenir, relieved it was over but also strangely exhilarated to have experienced world-class treatment from a team who appear to be at the top of their game.\nThe next step is to find out how effective it has been. \nIn late August, I will head to Moorfields Hospital, where the doctors will examine my eye and assess the extent of the damage to my tumour.", "topic": "technology", "thumbnail": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.283.03340/img/correspondents/circles/rorycellanjones.png"}, {"title": "Renting: How landlords can refuse to let to tenants with children", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-48938553?intlink_from_url=&link_location=live-reporting-story", "content": "Landlords can refuse potential tenants with children when letting out a UK property, which has prompted complaints from some of those turned down.\nSome families searching for a home to rent say it is unfair and discriminatory to rule out tenants with children.\nBut landlords point out that not all properties are suitable for youngsters, and that they are within their rights to refuse.\nThe debate has been played out on the \n.\nTom Dedynski has two children, aged nine and five, but has separated from his wife. \nHe was looking for a two-bedroom home to rent in Peterborough so he had enough room for his children to come to live with him during various weekends and at other times. He thought he had found the perfect place - a semi-detached house with a garage and driveway.\n\"I was honest with the letting agent that the kids would visit,\" the 33-year-old says. \"I had not rented for 15 years and wanted to be honest about the situation.\n\"I was told the landlord did not want children - and that was that.\n\"I was disappointed. It felt a bit harsh. This was a small family home.\"\nHe subsequently found another property to rent, but says that the experience did not feel fair.\nOther tenants say they have had similar experiences and argue that this amounted to discrimination. One says that the deposit should cover any mess or damage caused by children, but that youngsters do not necessarily create more damage than older people.\nDarren Minkin lets out nine properties in the Bournemouth area, and he is happy for tenants with children to live in most of them.\nYet, in his 20 years' experience, he says that there are some that are not always suitable for children.\nOne is a conversion, which is now a house in multiple occupation. A number of older tenants live there and there are various communal areas. As a result, he says, it is not suitable for young children.\nAnother is a flat adjoined to some student digs. Sometimes the students will be studying and sometimes, in the evening, they may be partying.\nThe result is that the near-neighbours can easily disturb each other and, as a result, he rules out potential tenants with children - although anyone who has children while they live there is always allowed to stay, he says.\n\"They are not rigid rules,\" the 51-year-old says. \"But you have to make a judgement. It is gut instinct - sometimes you are wrong and sometimes right.\"\nJohn Stewart, policy manager for the Residential Landlords Association, says a bigger proportion of homes rented privately (35%) have children living in them than in the social rented sector.\n\"That said, not all private rented homes are suitable for children, for example Houses of Multiple Occupation or city centre blocks of flats that may have no nearby space for children to play,\" he says. \n\"Landlords should always ensure that properties they rent to families with children are suitable and safe to meet the needs of such tenants.\" \nThere is nothing in law across the UK that compels a landlord to have to rent to tenants with children.\nSuch tenants remain a significant part of the rental sector. In England, 1.7 million families raise children in rental properties, among 4.7 million households in total in the sector. In Scotland, 24% of the 360,000 households in the private rental sector are households with children.\nWhile landlords can decide whether or not to have tenants with children in their properties, if they set rules that apply to everyone but indirectly make it more difficult for women to rent, this may be sex discrimination. \nIf a landlord refuses to rent to a single mother or someone who is pregnant, the tenant might argue that she is being discriminated against by the landlord. \nUnder the Equality Act, the law says someone cannot be treated unfairly or differently if this is connected to who they are.

Now, the thing about the adaptive immune system is it needs data, just like the brain needs data.\"\n on BBC Radio 4.\nAnd that \"data\" is coming from microbes and the chemicals they produce. They provoke a reaction in the immune system that can last a lifetime.  \nProf Rook says: \"The initial setting up of the immune system occurs during the first weeks and months of life.\n\"We know that because there's a window of opportunity during those first months of life when if you give antibiotics you can disrupt the microbiota and then in adulthood those individuals are more likely to have immunological problems and are more likely to put on weight.\" \nThis is the idea that some parents are buying into when they perform vaginal seeding. \nEven the type of home you bring your baby back to may affect their long-term health. \nResearch has shown households with dogs have lower rates of asthma. \nThe idea is they help us swim against the hygiene tide by traipsing their muddy paws round the house and sticking their noses into everything.\n\"The speculation has always been that the dog brings, from the outside, microbes that are helpful in stimulating the infant's immune system,\" says Prof Anita Kozyrskyj, from the University of Alberta.\nShe is analysing data on about 3,500 families in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development Study. \nOne of its findings is that the microbiomes of three-month-olds is far richer and more diverse (a good sign) if there is a pet in the house. \nTwo types of beneficial bacteria seemed to be more common. \n\"The \nhave been associated with leanness and the \nhave been associated with reduced risk of allergic disease.\"\nBreastfeeding or formula, antibiotics and method of delivery all affect the microbiome. \nBut studies into the microbiome and long-term health have often been too small to be definitive.  \nThe Baby Biome study is aiming to collect faecal samples from 80,000 babies. \nThat will be a lot of soiled nappies to analyse, but it will be an unparalleled resource for interrogating the impact of decisions made around birth. \nMany of those will be out of parents' hands. \nNo doctor or parent would hold back on life-saving antibiotics because of an uncertain long-term impact. \nThis study will let scientists see which microbes the body first hooks up, what that means years later and, tantalisingly, whether damaging relationships with the wrong bacteria can be repaired. \nThe faecal samples will end up at the Wellcome Sanger Institute in Cambridge and in the hands of microbial enthusiasts such as Dr Trevor Lawley.\n\"My latest favourite microorganism is \n,\" he says.\n\"It is one of the first bugs to colonise humans early in life, and we believe they feed off sugars in the breast milk. \n\"So, there's a very sophisticated evolutionary set-up where the bugs are passed from the mother to child and the mother nurtures that bug to establish the early microbiome.\"\nDr Lawley's lab will be trying to uncover every microbe that colonises a newborn and what that means later in life. \nHe thinks the end result of the project will be to change policy around avoidable antibiotic use and Caesarean sections. \nOr, alternatively, \"maybe we could culture the bugs from the mums to purposefully colonise the babies to allow their microbiome to mature and develop properly\" - in other words, a scientifically controlled version of vaginal seeding. \nSo are some parents just ahead of the game?\nProf Brocklehurst says: \"At the moment some parents believe this hypothesis enough that they are doing their own vaginal seeding.\n\"Now, there could be real downsides to that.\"\nOne concern is dangerous bugs could be transferred. \nUp to a quarter of women are thought to carry group-B strep in their vagina, and exposing babies to this bacterium could be fatal. \nProf Brocklehurst says: \"It too early to start introducing bacteria artificially into the baby until we've got a good handle on how likely this is to be the mechanism or not.\"\nFollow James ", "topic": "health", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/320/cpsprodpb/A3FB/production/_100897914_howyou'reborn.jpg"}, {"title": "Porn trolling lawyer jailed for 14 years", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48662813", "content": "An American lawyer who ran an x-rated online fraud scheme \nPaul Hansmeier shared copies of pornographic films online and then sued people who downloaded them, for copyright infringement.\nVictims were told to pay a $3000 (\u00a32,383) \"settlement fee\" to avoid further legal action.\nThe scheme is believed to have raised about $3m for Hansmeier and his accomplice over a three-year period.\n\"It is almost incalculable how much your abuse of trust has harmed the administration of justice,\" the judge said at the hearing where Hansmeier was sentenced.\n\"The major harm here is what happens when a lawyer acts as a wrecking ball,\" she added.\nWhile many firms have been employed by film and music makers to prosecute copyright pirates, Hansmeier -

Henman Hill was so full that cordons were put in place to help ease overcrowding. \nThe queue for the resale ticket office was hundreds long yet there was little chance of any of the near 15,000 people on Centre Court budging from their seats.\nDavid Beckham was back in the Royal Box for a second successive day to see his fellow sporting legends, Sir David Attenborough was on the edge of his seat and actors Jude Law and Hugh Grant were mesmerised by the unfolding drama. \nThis, as it proved and always was going to be, was one of those \"I was there\" moments.\nIt may not have been as dramatic as the 2008 final but the final stages were full of tension, with Nadal saving four match points.

But Spaniard Nadal - four years his junior - still came unstuck.\n\"Nadal dug his toes in, he knew he had to make Federer serve it out. We know they're both very resilient players,\" said former British number one Tim Henman on BBC Two.\n\"What surprised me was when the rallies extended out, it was Federer who was coming out on top. He was driving in, looking to finish the points at the net, and for three of four sets it was a masterclass from Federer.\n\"Historically we've seen Nadal dominate when he extends the rallies. At 37, Federer - you felt - might get tired but it was just phenomenal.\n\"Nadal was always playing catch up. Federer on his serve was always up 15-love you felt, Nadal was never really up love-15 and able to get the crowd on side.\"\nFederer's eight Wimbledon titles are more than any other man in history and if he beats Djokovic he will match Martina Navratilova's success in women's singles.\nHis performance against Nadal perhaps set a precedent for what is to come on Sunday, but in Djokovic he faces a defending champion eager not to relinquish his title.\n\"It was surprising how aggressive and how consistent Federer was,\" added Henman.\n\"On the back of that performance, it's going to be very interesting to start thinking about the dynamics of the final.\"\nA near flawless #Federer defeats #Nadal to get into yet another #Wimbledon final! Godlike tennis from the 37-year-old. Unreal stuff!\nRoger Federer was absolutely brilliant today. His second serve stat for points won and his backhand were incredible today.

Incredible.\nThat backhand of Federer should be declared as the eighth wonder of the world\nI do love Roger Federer. For me, he is the greatest sportsman of all time.\nThe tennis world will never ever be the same when these guys are not around anymore. Two of the best sportsmen I've ever seen and they are now relatively old and still nobody can get near them.\nSometimes it feels like the game needs young stars to come through. But when you watch a high-quality match like that, you want Federer vs Nadal at Wimbledon forever.\n: Federer has just laid the ghosts of 2008 to rest, and if that's the final time he and Nadal play each other at #Wimbledon, what a match to close it out.\nFederer and Djokovic's last meeting came at the Paris Masters last year but not since the 2015 Wimbledon final have they gone head-to-head on grass. Their last two meetings on this surface have resulted in Djokovic victories.\nIn fact on all surfaces, eight of their last 10 meetings have gone the Serb's way. But Federer is someone who can never be written off.\n\"It's just staggering. Nobody has really shown this sort of longevity - not at this level anyway,\" said BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.\nBut are there chinks in Federer's armour?\n\"The only thing that slightly concerns me was that he admitted he was exhausted at the beginning of his interview,\" added Fuller. \"That must have delighted Novak Djokovic.\"", "topic": "sport", "thumbnail": "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"}, {"title": "Cricket World Cup quiz: What do you remember of the group stages?", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48911616", "content": "The World Cup group stage, which began on 30 May, is over and we're down to just four teams: India, Australia, England and New Zealand.\nBut how much of the group stages do you remember?\nHave a go at our quiz and share your results with friends on social media.\nGood luck.\n", "topic": "sport", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/12C27/production/_107793867_fans_index_getty.png"}, {"title": "Wimbledon: Rafael Nadal & Roger Federer's 2008 final - what made it so special?", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/tennis/44517976", "content": "John McEnroe describes it as \"the greatest match ever played\" and, 10 years on, the 2008 Wimbledon final between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer remains the high point of a rivalry that continues to dominate tennis.  \nThe final - played out over nearly seven hours because of rain delays - ended with a 22-year-old Nadal finally dethroning Federer, holding off a thrilling fightback from the five-time champion to win 6-4 6-4 6-7 (5-7) 6-7 (8-10) 9-7 as darkness descended on an enraptured Centre Court.\nIt was the last of three successive Wimbledon finals between two players who have won a combined 37 Grand Slam titles. They have not met at Wimbledon since but, incredibly, will go into this year's tournament ranked one and two in the world, having split the past six Slams between them.\nHere, BBC Sport speaks to four people who witnessed an extraordinary occasion - seven-time Grand Slam champion\nwho commentated on the match for NBC, umpire \n long-time Wimbledon locker-room attendant \n and \n - the BBC's tennis correspondent from 2003 to 2013. \nThis is how they saw \"the greatest match\".\nOn 6 July 2008 - the day of the match - Federer was a month short of his 27th birthday and had spent 231 consecutive weeks as world number one. \nBut Nadal was close to toppling him. Four weeks earlier, he destroyed Federer at Roland Garros - winning 6-1 6-3 6-0 for his fourth consecutive French Open title. Could the Swiss recover to take revenge on his favoured surface?\nFederer had beaten Nadal in four sets in the 2006 Wimbledon final, and five sets 12 months later. Both men were playing for a slice of history - Nadal trying to become the first man to win the French Open and Wimbledon back to back since Bjorn Borg in 1980, Federer attempting to go ahead of Borg by winning a sixth consecutive Wimbledon.\nIt was also the last match played on Centre Court before a roof was installed, so the circumstances - with repeated rain interruptions, and a final finishing at twilight - are unlikely to be repeated. \n \"Everybody was wondering whether this was going to be the day Federer's great Wimbledon reign came to an end. Nadal was edging closer but still Federer was the king. It was beautifully set up.\" \n \"Roger was his usual calm, collected self. If he was nervous, he did not show it. Rafa was also his usual self, a tiny bit on edge, which was due, I think, to the weather.\"\n\n\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n\n                        \n \"I remember how well Nadal was moving, how cleanly he was striking the ball, how well he was serving.

I talked to different guys in there very quietly, not talking about the tennis, not talking about what could happen next or what did happen.\"\nFederer, speaking in \n said: \"My problem was I had lost in the French Open final a month earlier against Rafa in a terrible way. He crushed me. So when I went into the Wimbledon final, I felt like, 'Oh my God, this is going to be really difficult.' I think it took me two sets to shake it off and I believe that rain delay probably woke me up.

We have a little bench at the back of our commentary box which I was sitting on. I was absolutely transfixed. Of course, part of you is hoping you get a fifth set because you'll be the commentator for it but on the other hand you know you're watching a great final and potentially a new champion. Nadal was so close to finishing it there and all those emotions were going on.

It was obviously the players, the magnitude of the situation, playing the Wimbledon final, and certainly the way it panned out. The battle that Roger was having with Rafa but also with himself, squandering the lead in the second set and getting way down and then having to pull out two sets in the tie-break.\"\n\"If ever there was a tie-break to prove Federer's champion quality, it was that one. The greatest pull out their greatest shots when it really matters and that's what Federer did. That felt absolutely massive, him winning that tie-break.\" \n\"Two incredible players playing an incredible match. You cannot be screaming or clapping but you can deeply enjoy it. I can remember a few points in that match and inside I was saying, 'wow, what a great shot' or 'what a great point'.\"\nNadal, speaking in \n said: \"I could lose the final. But I wasn't going to fail. I'd be ready to compete till the end. Federer could win, but I wasn't going to lose.\"\n \"All bets were off by that point. The momentum was with Federer because he'd won the fourth set. History was with Federer because he was the five-time champion, but there was still this unknown of what Nadal was going to offer in the decider. He had played so well to that point. Only a fool would have written him off. It was clear in the early games, even though Federer was serving first, that Nadal wasn't going anywhere.\"\n\"I was fortunate enough that people talked about my match with Bjorn in 1980 as one of the great matches. But I was watching the 2008 final and sitting back and saying to myself: 'This is the best match I've ever seen at Wimbledon.'\n\"Towards the end, I was virtually not saying anything in the commentary box. I thought what I was witnessing was so great and the players were rising to the occasion - anyone watching could tell it was going to be a match that people would talk about for generations to come. To me that's an easy gig when you're watching a match like that. When it is that good you sort of kick back and put your arms back.\"\nI was sent out about 21:10 for the Charlie Pasarell-Pancho Gonzales match in 1969 (the second-longest singles match in Wimbledon history) and you could hardly see the white balls. The supervisor could not believe they were still playing. It was the same that day. I went down about 21:00 and thought 'they have to call this soon'. \n\"I always think television gives a false impression because of the filters. You had to be there to appreciate how dark it was in those final games. When it got to 7-7 it was absolutely obvious there were two more games left. They wanted to bring them off at a level score. It would have been unfair to call them back with one person serving for the match or serving to stay in the match.\"\n\"Obviously it was getting dark and the Hawk-Eye went off because of the darkness. Neither of the players mentioned it before the match ended. I think the players were so much into it that they did not even realise. We agreed with the referee, Andrew Jarrett, that we would have to stop the match at 8-8.\"\n\n\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n\n                        \n\"To me, it was the greatest match I'd ever watched, the greatest match ever played anywhere.\"\n \"It was like nothing we've seen before. There have been some great Wimbledon finals, but it was the intensity I remember from that final that really stays with me. The ability of these two men to bring out the big shots when it really mattered.\" \n \"Most winners have beer and Champagne. Rafa, his uncle Toni and physio Rafael Maymo had ice cream - that's how they celebrated.\" \n\"It was 10pm by the time we went behind the scenes for the press conferences and the interviews. I remember getting changed into my dinner jacket in a toilet at Wimbledon so by the time I interviewed Nadal, I could be hot-footing it to central London to get to the champions' dinner. In true old-school, pre-war BBC tradition I interviewed the champion, Nadal, in a bow tie.\"\n\"I was super concentrated over hours so I couldn't get some sleep before 4-5am. Then I had to wake up really early to catch a plane. It was a tough Monday. But how lucky I am to be the official of that match? It's great that nobody remembers me in a way, but being part of this match, and having the best seat in the stadium, is just something unforgettable.\"", "topic": "sport", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/0C31/production/_102212130_embrace_getty2.jpg"}, {"title": "Man Utd striker Romelu Lukaku set to stay at club amid Inter Milan interest", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/48967876", "content": "Belgium forward Romelu Lukaku looks increasingly likely to be staying at Manchester United. \nIt had been expected Inter Milan would try and sign Lukaku, 26, following the appointment of long-time admirer Antonio Conte as manager.\nHowever, there has been no bid tabled so far.

On the other end of the line was two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova.\nShe had let somebody posing as a boiler repair man into her flat and, while her back was turned, he held a knife to her throat. In fighting him off, the nerves in the thumb and index finger on her left, tennis-playing hand were severed, and the rest of her fingers were badly cut. The index finger was left barely hanging by its skin.\nKvitova says she is fortunate to be alive. Doctors gave her a less-than-10% chance of playing tennis again.\nShe defied the odds and returned to competition just five months later, and has since won eight tournaments as well as reaching the Australian Open final in January.\n\"I always knew I am a fighter on the court but I never really knew that I am an even bigger fighter off the court,\" the Czech tells BBC Sport.\nThe 29-year-old is among the favourites for Wimbledon, which starts on Monday, and has been close to taking the world number one ranking this year.\nRadim Zondra, 33, was sentenced in March to eight years in jail for the attack on Kvitova but denies any involvement and has lodged an appeal.\nFrom the sleepy Moravian town of Fulnek in the eastern Czech Republic, where people remember 'the little girl cycling with racquets on her back', to the town of Prostejov, where the attack happened, we visit the places and meet the people who have shaped the player with a reputation as one of the nicest on the women's tennis tour.\nAnd she tells us how her life changed forever in a few seconds.\nRush hour in the small town of Prostejov - about 35 miles from Brno, the Czech Republic's second largest city - is like any other time of day.\nPerhaps the 32-degree heat has slowed things down but no-one's in a hurry, there's a queue at the ice cream hatch, people are enjoying beers under parasols, and the traffic is moving.\nIt feels quiet and safe.\nThat probably goes some way to explaining why Kvitova was living in an ordinary flat here, and not in a guarded VIP complex.\nThe gates at the red-and-cream block where she had a ground-floor apartment are open and the only obvious security is a picture indicating a video intercom system.\nThe word \"psychopath\" is graffitied on the surrounding concrete wall, and an old grey fluff-less tennis ball lies on the ground a couple of metres from the front door.\nThe grey concrete building next door is home to a mattress shop, a pub and a beauty salon, and the rest of the neighbourhood is a mix of blocks of Communist-era flats and low-rise colourful houses.\n\"It's not an area of rich people, not a place where you'd would expect someone like Kvitova to live,\" says Michal Cagala, a television presenter from Prostejov who reported on the court case.\n\"It is a normal neighbourhood with average buildings. I always felt that Prostejov was a very safe town and it was surprising that something could happen in such a calm, small town in the middle of nowhere. Nobody expected it.\"\nNo-one really expects it in the country as a whole - Czech crime figures for 2016 show a total of 5,050 cases of violent crime reported - that includes anything from pub brawls to the most serious assaults - and there were 1,630 reported robberies. \nCompare that to the more than one million violent crimes reported in England and Wales during a similar period.\n\"Petra Kvitova was in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" said Cernosek, the manager of the Prostejov tennis club who financed the start of her career and remains close to her.\nAnd she was not even supposed to be there.\nA last-minute change of plan meant that instead of travelling with Cernosek to an event in Brno, she had decided to make her own way there.\nWhile she was getting ready to leave, the doorbell rang and the man said he had come to look at the boiler. She later told the court she let him in because she was expecting a doping test.\n\"He asked me to turn on the hot water tap and at that moment I had a knife against my neck. I grabbed it with both hands,\" she said in the testimony she gave via video link in a side room in the Brno court so she did not have to look at the accused.\n\"I held the blade with my left hand. I snatched it away, I fell on the floor and there was blood everywhere.\"\nKvitova told her attacker she needed to go to hospital and asked if he wanted money. She says he left after she gave him 10,000 crowns (\u00a3350) - about half the average Czech monthly wage after tax.\nShe then phoned Cernosek, who was in the car making his way to Brno.\n\"It was a shock,\" the 71-year-old says. \"When Petra rang, I thought she must be having a problem with her car.\n\"I rang an ambulance, I rang the police, I rang the head of A&E,\" he says.\nCernosek then called leading physiotherapy professor Pavel Kolar, who suggested he speak to specialist hand surgeon Radek Kebrle. Cernosek's driver then took Kvitova the 145 miles to Kebrle's surgery in Vysoke nad Jizerou.\n\"She was weakened because of the bleeding but because she was being so brave no-one knew how bad it was until she got to hospital,\" says Cernosek. \"We thought it would be the end of her tennis.\n\"If she had come with me, it wouldn't have happened,\" he added ruefully.\nKvitova had a four-hour operation, with doctors warning her that her tennis career could be over and she might even lose her fingers.\n\"When we saw the pictures, one finger was just hanging on skin. I said it just wasn't possible that this girl can return,\" Cernosek says.\n\"She showed such mental strength but also she is so talented - if she didn't have that much talent in her then she would never have come back. The injury was so bad some people would never have even held a pen in that hand again, but she had to pick up a tennis racquet.\"\nKvitova gave a news conference just three days after the attack - with a huge bandage nearly up to her elbow - and was already talking about doing everything she could to come back.\nShe had been told she would need to rest for a minimum of six months, but five months later she was playing at the French Open.\nEfforts to rehabilitate did not even stop at meal times.\n\"During dinner someone from her team would hold her hand and massage it. For that first six months, year, every dinner - she'd take a bite of pasta and then have her hand massaged,\" Cernosek says.\nShe still does not have 100% mobility in her hand and there is no sensitivity in the tip of her index finger and thumb, but her determination to win has never faded.\nKvitova has always been determined. Ever since the start.\nIn Fulnek, Marie Valova points to some ordinary, concrete, blocks of flats - pre-fab housing from the Communist era known as 'panelaky' that are low in both cost and character. From there, she says, a young Kvitova used to ride her bike to the tennis courts every day.\nIt's a one kilometre route, taking in plenty of cobbles and pretty-coloured buildings and crosses the town square, where several years later she would show off her Wimbledon trophies.\nBack then, when her father trained her up to the age of 15, there were only two tennis courts. Now there are four plus a clubhouse Kvitova funded and a shiny sign branding it the Petra Kvitova tennis club.\n\"Other sports weren't possible in Fulnek - she would have had to travel,\" her dad Jiri tells BBC Sport. \"We just wanted her to do some sort of sport so we picked tennis.\n\"She never once said she didn't want to go - we never argued about it. She was an obedient child.\n\"We never had any big aims for her and we never thought she would be so famous. She is just an incredible fighter and does not give up. It is through her hard work and tenacity that she has achieved all she has.\"\nDespite their daughter's huge success, Kvitova's parents still live in the same flat and their friends speak of modest and unassuming people - in rather the same way those on the tennis tour view Kvitova herself.\nThe enduring memory of Kvitova for many is of a determined child heading for the town's clay courts.\n\"I remember her riding on her bike through the town with six racquets on her back with her dad,\" says local resident Gabriela Klabackova. \"You could tell she had the makings of a winner.\"\nValova is pretty sure where she gets it from.\n\"I used to play mixed doubles with her father, Jiri,\" she says. \"We didn't lose very often! He doesn't take defeat well.\"\nShe says the town was shocked by the attack on Kvitova, which was a frequent topic of conversation in the pub at the time, but that her comeback was no surprise because \"she is a Czech lion\" - the animal features on the country's coat of arms.\nKvitova is a hero of Fulnek - where children have taken a fistful of clay from the court just to say they have 'something that Petra played on' - and is only one of two people to be awarded the freedom of the town.\nThe other is John Comenius, the 17th century philosopher and educator whose face adorns the country's 200-crown bank note.\nWhen Kvitova is in a big final, residents gather to watch her on a big screen - cheers and tears often washed down with a good Czech beer.\nWhen she won her first Wimbledon title in 2011 there were 150 people crammed into the town's Cultural Centre, and fans gathered in the tennis clubhouse to watch January's Australian Open final.\nDespite defeat by Osaka in that match she rose to second in the world rankings - but since then an arm injury has forced her out of the French Open and the pre-Wimbledon grass season. She is currently ranked sixth in the world.\nValova, who runs the local museum, is an enthusiastic member of the Petra Kvitova fan club. She and about 12 others from Fulnek travel to Fed Cup matches with flags painted on their faces and waving a big flag that says 'Pojd!' ('Come on') - the phrase Kvitova shouts to herself during matches.\nShe says she gets the occasional tourist asking her about Kvitova if they visit the church that houses the museum, and she sometimes gives them one of the player's signed photographs.\nIf you visit St Joseph's church, you might even be asked to stand still and feel the positive energy - those who work there say experts who have measured it say it has twice the positive energy of Lourdes, the pilgrimage site in France that many people claim is a place of miracles and healing.\nBefore Kvitova's own healing, the church housed an exhibition of her trophies in 2015, drawing just over 1,000 people in a week - not bad for a town whose population is 3,000.\nThe player herself attended, and indeed is still seen around when she visits her parents or one of her older brothers, Libor, who is the deputy head of Kvitova's old school and also coaches at the tennis club.\nJiri Sindler, who works at the hotel next to the tennis club, says she orders a traditional dish when she eats there: \"Something fried - a schnitzel or fried cheese, things she can't get anywhere else.\"\nWhile Kvitova has said it is important for her to always remain 'Petra from Fulnek', there came a time when her tennis grew too big for her town.\nPlaying on the junior circuit in the Czech Repubic, Kvitova's talent was soon spotted by Prostejov scout Jaroslav Balaz and it was time to move on.\n\"It was a difficult time when I was around 15. I was in puberty, I played just with my father in Fulnek - it was probably just too much being with my father 24 hours and also still together at home, on the tennis court,\" Kvitova tells BBC Sport from Prague, where she now trains.\nAt first she just went to Prostejov for a couple of days a week but then, at the age of 16, she took up the club's offer of a private coach, accommodation, on-site gym, physios, access to 17 courts and different surfaces to the clay she had grown up with. \n\"Of course for my father it was not easy,\" she says. \"Suddenly he found out that he is not any more the coach of me, but he has still had an impact on me and on my game and everything but just not really as a coach. It was a pretty difficult time for us but luckily we have been through it and we did a good job.\"\nCernosek says the way she handled the transition was a key part of her success.\n\"She showed her maturity by saying: 'Dad, stop meddling, I trust my coaches and I'm going to do it the way my coach is telling me to.' That doesn't always happen that a 16-year-old girl stands up to her father,\" he says.\nShe, meanwhile, credits Cernosek for launching her career, saying he gave her money to travel to tournaments and without him she would not have been able to play tennis.\nThe wall behind where Cernosek sits in his office is bursting with photos of him and various sporting successes - hosting Usain Bolt many times at the Ostrava athletics meet, Roger Federer at the Davis Cup. A Fed Cup and Davis Cup trophy sit on the shelf below. \nBut it is clear whose success he enjoys the most.\n\"I'm a fan of every Czech player, but Petra is the one I am the biggest fan of,\" he says. \nHe drank champagne with her in the locker room after one Wimbledon triumph, and took her to meet the Czech president after another.\nBut he has also cried - none more so than after January's Australian Open final, when she lost to Naomi Osaka. He saw what the loss - in her first Grand Slam final since the attack - did to her.\n\"Australia was the most I've ever seen her cry, she was so upset. She had the potential to win that,\" he says. \"I never saw her cry the way she did after that final.\"\nOn the court and off the court, the attack has changed her.\nWhile Kvitova's hand has healed and her tennis is back on track, her outlook has altered. \n\"I'm really appreciating small things even more than I was before - I always tried to enjoy life but I don't think I was able to enjoy it as now,\" she says.\n\"I'm probably more relaxed, maybe on the court as well. But off the court I am more appreciating if just the sun is coming out, or if I see my family or my friends or whatever. I'm not really caring about the small things or the small problems.\"\nHer friends say she has grown warier - she now wants to approve every name using her player guest tickets at events and has learnt to say 'no', including to lucrative sponsorship deals if she is not comfortable with them.\n\"The bad thing of course is my trust in people, especially men, has got worse,\" she says. \"Sometimes I do have those flashbacks when I am somewhere alone or something is happening around me.\n\"Sometimes I'm scared of course about the people around, still looking back behind me what is happening there and sometimes I'm walking too fast to be in a safe place.\n\"It's changed my perspective - sometimes I'm just really appreciating that I'm alive.\n\"It's something which I couldn't really imagine that could happen but in a few seconds your life is in a totally different place - I didn't really realise that before but now I really do. I'm just trying to live for 100% right now.\"\nWhether that will bring more Grand Slam titles, no-one can say, but she knows she has achieved so much more than that.", "topic": "sport", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/1831F/production/_106930199_sport_insight_banner.png"}, {"title": "Netball World Cup 2019: What happened on day one in Liverpool?", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/netball/48967065", "content": "Zimbabwe made history on day one of the Netball World Cup after winning on their tournament debut. \nThe Gems, ranked 14th in the world, beat Sri Lanka 79-49 on Friday in front of a big contingent of fans, who went on to celebrate with music and dancing outside the Liverpool Arena. \nThere were mixed results for the home nations in their opening group matches.\n 64-32 and \n won 53-35 \n but \n suffered a heavy \n against defending champions Australia.\nTracey Neville's England side, ranked third in the world, won bronze in 2015 and come in to this tournament on home soil as one of the favourites following their gold medal at the Commonwealth Games. \nAustralia are the most successful team in the event's history, having won 11 titles. \nTheir long-time rivals \n, who have lifted the trophy on four occasions but have slipped to fourth in the rankings, started with a 64-45 victory over Malawi while \n beat Singapore 69-34 in the first session of the day.\nWorld number two side \n thrashed Fiji 85-29 and \n won 76-45 against Trinidad and Tobago, whose 40-year-old attacker Rhonda John-Davis secured a new tournament record for playing in her sixth World Cup.\nAll 16 teams play three times in three days in the first round-robin preliminary stage.\nZimbabwe face a much tougher test in their second World Cup match when they play Australia in Saturday's opening tie (09:00 BST).\nThere is an eye-catching clash between England and Scotland (15:00 BST), while Northern Ireland are looking to bounce back when they take on Sri Lanka (09:25 BST). \nElsewhere, New Zealand play Barbados, Malawi take on Singapore, Uganda go up against Samoa, Jamaica face Trinidad & Tobago and South Africa play Fiji.

But the close proximity of the walls and the lack of run-off areas means the margin for error is smaller, and races see frequent yellow flags and safety cars.\nThe only possible way to get by your rival is to dive for the momentary gaps, or attack on a straight with the extra 25kw of power from the Attack Mode or Fanboost bonuses afforded to the drivers during a race.\nIn Morocco, Britain's Sam Bird lost his place at the front of the race to the two BMW i Andretti drivers of Antonio Felix da Costa and Alexander Sims, who swapped positions as leaders until an over-excited Sims locked up, showing his team-mate the wall.\nDa Costa was out, and fuming, as Jerome d'Ambrosio inherited victory.\n\n\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n\n                        \nCars getting as close as they can is something fans love, even if it doesn't always work out so successfully for the drivers.\nIn Formula E there's less 'dirty air' disrupting the flow from the aerodynamics of the car in front - as in F1 - meaning drivers can get closer to their rivals. \nHaving spent much of the Hong Kong E-Prix locked in battle, Virgin Envision Racing's Sam Bird punctured leader Andre Lotterer's right rear tyre when aiming for an overtake on the final lap.\nBird was given a five-second penalty for what was a \"disgusting move\", according to Lotterer, stripping him of his win after he had already collected the trophy on the podium and dropping him down to sixth.\n\n\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n\n                        \nIn previous years, Formula E drivers had to pit for a new car as the batteries did not last for the duration of the race. \nBut the new 'Gen2' cars can hold on for the 45-minutes-plus-one-lap race duration as long as drivers conserve enough energy to cross the line with some battery life remaining.\nIn Mexico, the race went to the line. Right to the line. \nMahindra's Pascal Wehrlein was about to take his first series victory after leading much of the race. Audi Sport's Lucas di Grassi spent much of it chasing him down but was unable to find a gap to overtake. \nInstead of forcing the issue, he wisely elected to ease the burden on his remaining 2% of battery power by drafting the leader.\nWhat followed was a wonderful edge-of-your-seat moment, Di Grassi swooping around Wehrlein just metres before the line and stealing victory as the 1% battery in the stricken Mahindra ticked down to zero.\n\n\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n\n                        \nOne key difference between Formula E and F1 is that in the electric series the cars run the same chassis and battery. Therefore no one car dominates. Instead, drivers must rely on skill - which explains why, until Monaco, there had been eight races with eight different winners.\nAway from racing, Formula E has been hosted by some of the biggest and most impressive cities around the world to share its environmental capabilities and showcase the best electric car technology the manufacturers have to offer.\nThe cars use road-suitable Michelin tyres which can be recycled, and across race weekends the series promotes the ban of single-use plastics, such as water bottles for spectators and teams.\nJust as F1 pushes the boundaries on design, technology, composite materials, and aerodynamic capabilities, Formula E is an avenue for the likes of Jaguar, Audi, BMW and other manufacturers to invest in the future of electric road cars.", "topic": "sport", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/118F/production/_107859440_vergne_getty.jpg"}, {"title": "Cricket World Cup final: 'Fire-breathing England can go all the way'", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/48957795", "content": "\n\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n\n                        \nEnglish sporting semi-finals have not been happy experiences in the past 12 months. Too much heartbreak, too many what-ifs, too many next times.\nThe only what-ifs at Edgbaston were what England might have scored had they batted their full 50 overs. The heartbreak was all Australian. The next time is a World Cup final at Lord's on Sunday.\nOn Monday, Australia's players had taken their shoes and socks off and walked the outfield here. The idea was to feel the positive energy coming out of the earth. On Thursday England took their pants down for them too. \nSome of it came from England's outstanding opening bowlers, who produced a combined spell of 3-27 off their first 11 overs.\nEven more came from Jason Roy, smashing 85 off 65 balls to turn a run-chase into a run-romp, crashing Steve Smith for three consecutive sixes, the last somewhere into Solihull.\nIt came fizzing back at Australia from the stands, because there are few places as fun to be as an England supporter than Edgbaston when Australia are in town. \nIt had been 9,989 days since England last beat Australia in the World Cup, but it has also been 26 years since the dominant cricketing nation of that quarter-century have won at this ground.\nEngland come here and to Trent Bridge like a team transformed from the one that has routinely been rolled over at Lord's across the same period, to the one that was comprehensively beaten by Aaron Finch's men in north-west London just a fortnight ago.\nOn Thursday morning, Australia won the toss. That was supposed to be half the battle in this tournament of faltering chases and slow pitches. David Warner then clattered the opening delivery from Chris Woakes through extra cover for four.\nAs auguries go it was a giant raspberry. Almost nothing Australia did from that moment on went right. Almost everything England touched turned to gold.\nAustralia's openers had produced 43% of their side's runs in the tournament to this point. The partnership of Finch and Warner has averaged 127 a match. Finch had four centuries in his previous nine innings against England.\nThis was different. This was Edgbaston, this was England - the souped-up, fire-breathing, chest-beating England.\nJofra Archer bowled full and fast to trap Finch lbw for a golden duck. Woakes produced pace and bounce to get Warner snagged in the slips.\n\n\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n\n                        \nA game that was to end with choruses of \"cricket's coming home\" had its course set. Even then few in the jubilant home support could have envisaged just how one-dimensional the plot would be.\nNo fourth-act terrors, no jeopardy, no crisis for the hero to fight his way through. It was a summer blockbuster in which the evil nemesis turned out to be a pantomime dame. England fans first booed and then laughed. \nWorld Cup semi-finals are not supposed to be like this. For starters, Australia usually win them. Since England last reached the last four of the World Cup Australia have actually won the thing four times.\nThey are also not meant to resemble Test cricket in their opening exchanges, but that is how Edgbaston felt under the high clouds: three slips in, a batsman left bleeding and in need of stitches after having his helmet knocked off by a fast bowler, a team limping to 27 off the first 10 overs.\n\n\n                            Media playback is not supported on this device\n\n                        \nThe third Australia wicket went down with just 14 runs on the board, which, given Australia's record in this competition, was actually being used as a promising sign by some. The only time they had endured a worst start to a semi-final - slipping to 8-3 in Mohali in 1996 - they still went on to win.\nBut this is not the Australia of then and this is not the same old England.\nThe story of this team's rise to the world number one ranking has predominantly been one of blistering batting. When runs have come fast the team have bullied their opponents into submission.\nOn Thursday the bowling was fast and it was unrelenting.\nPeter Handscomb had last batted against Gloucestershire second XI 12 days ago. It was nowhere near the sort of preparation he required to face Archer breezing in to deliver 90mph howitzers.\nHis stumps had bolted long before he closed the gate between his bat and front pad against Woakes.\nIt is not just about raw pace with Archer. He has now bowled 338 dot balls in the tournament, more than any other bowler. Together with Woakes he produced 45 scoreless deliveries from the first 60 bowled.\nThere is artistry too: the knuckle-ball that foxed Glenn Maxwell into spooning a catch to Eoin Morgan at cover, a ruse so effective that the number seven was still blaming the pitch when he was halfway to the pavilion.\nArcher finished with 2-32 from 10 overs, a blend of parsimony and raw terror that was complemented first by Woakes' 3-20 off eight and then Adil Rashid's three wickets as Australia threatened a fightback that never came.\nA target of 224 might have been tricky to overhaul. No-one has been able to chase in this World Cup. Mitchell Starc had taken 22 of his 26 wickets bowling second.\nInstead the total went up in smoke and the party kicked upwards and on. Starc ended up being serenaded by the same song that had been used to torment another fast-bowling Mitchell Johnson. If that hadn't ended well for England, Roy and Jonny Bairstow turned the volume up and cut loose.\nSeldom was this slogging. It was a calculated assault that married risk to reward with supreme balance.\nWhen Nathan Lyon came on in the 11th over, the ball having turned appreciably for Rashid, Roy lofted his first ball over long-on for six. A single apiece, then a reverse-sweep for four.\nIt was thrilling and sensible at the same time, and that was before Finch had gambled on spin at the other end from Smith.\nA single, a wide, a single, a deep breath.

But it's a real high price,\" Becker said.\n\"You're sitting having a coffee with someone and you're headline news the next day.\n\"Just to compare it with the craziness we are witnessing now with Coco Gauff and she only reached the fourth round.\"\nBecker, who won six Grand Slams during his career, was one of the biggest sports stars in Germany in the 1980s and 1990s.\nNow 51, he says he found it daunting to carry the hopes of a nation, particularly when competing for his country at the Davis Cup.\nHowever, he thinks things are much harder now for modern players with the added pressure of social media and the internet. \nSpeaking to the \n, Becker said: \"I was still very young and felt intimidated by the scale of it, carrying a whole country. What happens if I fail? Have I disappointed all of you? And so expectations got out of hand a little bit.\n\"If I lost in the final it was like somebody died and people would criticise you on a personal level. \n\"You are walking down the street and big newspapers followed you every step of the way. \n\"But in those days we had no internet and no social media, I couldn't imagine what it would be like.\n\"It's so easy to post something on social media without any truth in it and yet you have to prove otherwise. That's not right.\"\nBecker also questioned the rise of celebrity culture and the impact it has on young people.\n\"We're living in strange times, celebrity culture is at an all-time high, but it is not the truth,\" he said.\n\"I am a celebrity because I've done something unusual but a lot of people are celebrities these days because they are a celebrity. They've never done anything in their life that is extraordinary other than being famous.\n\"So it is very difficult for young children. Do you want to be famous and successful? If so how is it defined? \n\"If you have 10 million followers on Twitter does that mean you are successful? We are living in dangerous times of value and what means what.\"\nDespite the pressures of fame, Becker says he had no regrets and that being a celebrity does have its upsides.\n\"You always get a seat in a restaurant. You can bend the rules a bit if you're famous,\" he added.\n\"Some of the old stories haunt me, but I smile about it. For me winning tennis matches was far more important.\n\"If someone said 35 years ago that I would have the success I had now, I would sign straight away.\"", "topic": "sport", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/7B7B/production/_107811613_gettyimages-994514190.jpg"}, {"title": "Super League: St Helens 32-10 Wigan Warriors - Leaders Saints seal third derby win", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/48920102", "content": "Super League leaders St Helens easily pulled off their third derby win of the season to beat in-form Wigan Warriors and move 10 points clear at the top.\nTommy Makinson sent Saints ahead after Zak Hardaker and Lachlan Coote exchanged penalty goals early on before he crossed again just before half-time.\nCoote, Kevin Naiqama and Jonny Lomax all crossed over after the break to give Saints a formidable lead.\nHardaker later ran in for Wigan but a Saints victory never looked in doubt.\nThe result is the third St Helens derby victory against Wigan this season after Justin Holbrook's side defeated the Cherry and Whites in the opening game of the season as well as a Good Friday rout at the DW Stadium.\nSaints' victory, combined with second-placed Warrington's failure to beat Salford Red Devils, widened their lead at the top, while Wigan slip a place to fifth after Sam Tomkins helped Catalans beat Huddersfield.\nWigan, whose head coach Adrian Lam \n earlier this week, had arrived at the Totally Wicked Stadium off the back of five consecutive wins.\nTheir recent form had transformed their season and turned them into play-off contenders, but they struggled to match St Helens' class.\nThe hosts sealed victory in front of a sell-out crowd in a rare derby fixture that was not being broadcast live on television.\nPrior to the game, Saints had named England and Great Britain international James Roby in their 19-man squad as he neared his return \nRoby did not make their matchday squad and the hosts were forced to name James Bentley as hooker, although it did not impede a dominant display.\n\"Every week is always a hard game but to play Warrington, go to Hull and then face our biggest rivals tonight - to come away with such a dominant win I couldn't be happier.\n\"We finished the first half really well and in the second half I thought we started well and then it got a bit scrappy at the end but that happens.\n\"To keep them to just one try, I thought we did a great job, because they've got so many dangerous players.\"\n\"I thought we started the game pretty well and we were aggressive and the team we wanted to be but there were a couple of slip-ups.\n\"We didn't attack well and once we were frustrated and under the pump we sort of referred back to type and were a completely different team.\n\"I give credit to St Helens tonight, they were pretty strong and I don't think they could have played much better than they did.\"\n Lomax, Makinson, Naiqama, Percival, Grace, Fages, Walmsley, Thompson, McCarthy-Scarsbrook, Knowles, Peyroux, Bentley, Coote.\n Amor, Lees, Ashworth, Smith.\nSarginson, Gildart, Burgess, Williams, Leuluai, Powell, Farrell, Navarrete, Isa, Marshall, Hardaker, Partington, Smithies.\n Bullock, Hankinson, Shorrocks, Byrne.\n Ben Thaler.", "topic": "sport", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/EEF7/production/_107857116_at3i0137.jpg"}, {"title": "The plane crash that killed Serie A's champions and their English coach", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46788983", "content": "Bill Lievesley had just got home from school when his mum came in and told him: \"People are saying there's been a plane crash.\" \nClose by on the outskirts of Turin, the wreckage of an aeroplane lay smouldering on the Superga hill, 700 metres up behind the giant basilica that overlooks the city.\nGoing through the suitcases and bodies, searchers eventually identified the victims and began to realise that among the 31 dead were Serie A's all-conquering champions, Il Grande Torino.\nIt was 4 May 1949 and Torino were set to win a fifth consecutive league title. With four matches of the season remaining, the team had flown out to play a testimonial match for a Benfica player in Lisbon.\nOn the way back, almost the entire squad was killed, including their Hungarian-Jewish manager who had escaped from the Nazis and their English coach Leslie Lievesley, a former Manchester United full-back who incredibly had survived three previous air crashes. His son Bill was about to turn 11.\nOn that late afternoon, news quickly spread throughout the north Italian city. By evening it had reached Sauro Toma, a defender who had not travelled with his team-mates because of injury. Scores of emotionally overwhelmed fans mobbed him in the street. Before his death in 2018, aged 92, he said he lived as someone \"condemned to survive, while my brothers perished\". \nThe plane had collided with the back of the basilica wall, amid thick fog. Later it was concluded malfunctioning equipment must have led the pilot to believe he was well clear of the building, realising only when it was too late.\nTwo days after the crash, half a million people lined the streets as the funerals were held. Torino were awarded the Serie A title, at the request of their rivals. Only fate could beat them, it was said. The team passed into legend not as the Invincibles but the Immortals. \nThe next season each top-flight club was asked to donate a player to Torino, to help them rebuild. The 1949-50 title was won by Juventus, as Torino finished sixth. They have won the league only once since, in 1975-76, the seventh title in the club's history. This season, city rivals Juve won their eighth in a row, and 35th of all time. \nThe Superga disaster is central to Torino's identity, and its legacy is not forgotten. Every year thousands congregate at the site where the plane came down. This year will be the 70th anniversary and Bill Lievesley will be among those present.\nHe first went back for the 60th anniversary, in 2009. He can't really say why he hadn't been before. \"I'd been saying it so long, 'now I'm going to do it'. I really owed it to my father to go, and to do it properly,\" he tells BBC Sport.\nOn that first trip back, 10 years ago, Bill walked all the way up to Superga and back down to the city again, twice, in two days. It's about 10km from Turin's centre, up twisting roads that lead to the summit finish in the Milan-Torino cycling race. He stripped the soles of his shoes.\nWe meet where he now lives, in England. The day grows dark as we talk in the comfort of his living room, drinking coffee. Bill is 80 and radiates warmth on a bitterly cold afternoon in south Yorkshire, looking back on a time when Turin was home.  \nAlong the hallway and up the stairs hangs his \"gallery of rogues\". There are photos of his dad, Leslie, as a Doncaster Rovers player and in a Manchester United team photo, alongside frames of his grandad Joe, goalkeeper for Sheffield United and Arsenal. \nLeslie Lievesley moved his wife and young son to north Italy in 1947, when he left his first job as a coach with Dutch side Heracles Almelo to join Torino, having turned down an offer from Marseille.  \nThe English coach was joining an already successful side. Torino became the first Italian team to win the league and cup double in 1943, the final season before Serie A was halted for two years during World War Two. They still hold three remarkable Italian top-flight records. \nIn 1947-48, Torino scored 125 goals in their 40 matches, finishing with a record goal difference of +92 on their way their fourth title in as many seasons. By the time of the Superga disaster they had not lost at home in more than six years, while their 10-0 victory over Alessandria in May 1948 remains the biggest in Serie A history.\nThis golden age for the club owed much to its president, Ferruccio Novo, who had lovingly signed up some of the country's best players, including Valentino Mazzola, Torino's star who became Italy's captain. Novo was devastated by the disaster. Mazzola had named one of his sons after him. \nNovo did not travel on the fateful journey because of a bout of flu. Having failed in the perhaps impossible task of rebuilding the team after the crash, he resigned as Torino president in 1953, three years after leading Italy to the World Cup finals. The Azzurri travelled to Brazil by boat rather than by plane.  \nThe other major influential figure in the club's success was Erno Egri Erbstein, the team's Hungarian manager who had been forced to return to his homeland following the 1938 anti-Semitic law that stripped Jews of their Italian citizenship under Benito Mussolini. \nErbstien escaped from a labour camp in Nazi-occupied Budapest, as is detailed in the book \n by Dominic Bliss. He would return to Torino after the war and continue to win football matches according to his attacking ideals, with help from his English coach. \nBorn in 1911, Leslie Lievesley got into coaching after his playing career was cut short by the war. He was at Crystal Palace, and Bill was a baby in Croydon, when in 1939 he signed up to join the Royal Air Force. He became a parachute dispatch officer, often involved in missions to drop soldiers, and sometimes spies, behind enemy lines. \nOn one such sortie, having been forced to return to base before completing their drop, his plane was shot down over Middle Wallop, just north of Southampton, by American anti-aircraft guns. Friendly fire. Everybody on board was killed, apart from Leslie, who walked out of it. \"He was hard as nails,\" Bill says of his dad. \"He probably thought he could beat Hitler single-handed.\" \nThere was a second crash in the war - although Bill can't recall the details. The third that Lievesley survived came in 1948 when, travelling with the Torino youth team, the plane's brakes malfunctioned on landing at Turin airport. Disaster was averted because the wing clipped a hangar and slowed the aircraft before it could collide with the terminal building.  \nThat same year, England travelled to Turin to play Italy. Seven of the Torino team lined up against an English side led by goalkeeper and captain Frank Swift, \n Stanley Matthews played out wide and Tom Finney scored twice in a 4-0 win. \nLievesley was by that time also coaching Italy - it was essentially the Torino team after all, in one match all 10 outfield players came from the club. Bill remembers the heavy defeat by England did his father's reputation little damage - if anything, it only increased the desire to learn from the inventors of the game. \nLievesley seemed to always enjoy support from those who mattered most, the players. According to Bill, it was the Torino players who asked for him to be promoted to the first team, having observed his good work with the youth side.\nAs a child, Bill would often be taken along to his father's training sessions - \"when my mother had had enough of me,\" he says. He might watch his dad work, or kick a ball about himself with the other kids hanging around Torino's old Filadelfia stadium. It closed in 1963, and for years it lay abandoned. In May 2017 it opened once more and is now back in use as a training ground. \nBill says he was never much of a footballer himself. Cycling was more his thing - twice he competed in the Tour of Britain. But there have been times when he has wondered, what if? What if his dad had chosen to take up the job at Marseille instead, for example. What if his mother had stayed in Italy?\n\"There were some people who thought she ought not to leave, but she decided she should bring my dad back home, to be buried with his father and brothers,\" he says. \n\"I wish we had stayed out there, quite frankly, but she did what she thought was best at the time. \n\"Coming back to England was not particularly easy. At first we lived with my grandmother in Rossington, not far from Doncaster. It wasn't like our apartment in Turin with marble floors, it was a colliery house. \n\"In Italy my mum and dad had something of a celebrity lifestyle. Gianni Agnelli, the future head of Fiat, was a big friend of my father's. He'd always be offering him a car but he wouldn't take one, he said they made people lazy. All the players would always cycle around the city. \n\"We stayed with my grandmother for about a year. It was a strange time for me, like I was walking around in a dream. I think I was just going through the day to day really. You cut yourself off a bit, don't you?\n\"They put me in for the 11-plus, which I obviously failed miserably. I knew all about Garibaldi but not very much about pounds, shillings and pence. It was all foreign to me.\n\"There was very little room in the house, no bath, no electricity, the toilet was outside, but I got used to it. Then my mother got some compensation money - either from the airline or the club, I'm not sure - and bought a house in Doncaster.\n\"I was very dependent on my mother, I really could have done with my father being there. I only knew him for those few years after the war. That's the sad thing of it.\" \nDuring the brief hours I visited Superga, having arrived by car and not on foot, the air was crisp and the sun's light especially bright as it reflected back off the spectacular snow-covered Alps in the distance. It was difficult to imagine the terrible sights and sounds of that disastrous day, when Torino's small three-engine Fiat passenger plane was immediately destroyed in a direct impact with the holy building that stands guard over the stunning valley below. \nThere is a memorial monument against the back wall where the plane came down. Football fans from all over the world have been coming here for years to pay their respects and have left scarves of many different colours. There used to be a museum within the basilica itself, before it was forced to move, and it is now housed in a much larger space in Grugliasco, a suburb of Turin.\nStrangely, the club itself offers no official support, funding or encouragement to the museum. In fact scores of items, relics of Torino's golden age, were discarded and left abandoned under a previous ownership. They now sit proudly as exhibits in the museum run by dozens of dedicated volunteers. \nThey have helped keep the memory of Il Grande Torino alive - not just for one day in May.", "topic": "sport", "thumbnail": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/onesport/cps/480/cpsprodpb/1831F/production/_106930199_sport_insight_banner.png"}, {"title": "Women's Rugby Super Series: England 20-18 France", "url": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/48947273", "content": "Emily Scarratt's late penalty saw England beat France 20-18 to maintain their 100% record and move top of the Women's Rugby Super Series table.\nAfter wins over USA and Canada, England started badly when Cyrielle Banet touched down after just over a minute.\nKelly Smith's try got England back in it but Caroline Boujard's try helped France to an 18-5 half-time lead.\nScarratt scored two tries and with eight minutes left, her penalty secured a lead for the first time - and a win.\nAfter the victory in San Diego, England are three points clear of New Zealand, who they play in their final game of the Series on Sunday.\nA win would ensure Simon Middleton's team officially become the world's best side.\nReacting to his side's ninth win in 2019, Middleton said: \"We showed the character in our team to come back from a tough position.
